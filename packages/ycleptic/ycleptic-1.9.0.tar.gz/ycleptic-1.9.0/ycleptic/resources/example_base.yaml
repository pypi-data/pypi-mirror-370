# Format specification for an example YAML configuration file
#
# The "name" of any directive may appear as a key whose value is specified by "type"
# and any dependent "directives".  Values with scalar types should only appear
# once in any directive set.  Values with list types may have multiple instances
# of each dependent directive.
#
# use "required: True" for scalar values that have no defaults but must be specified
# use "required: False" for any values that should not be assigned defaults
