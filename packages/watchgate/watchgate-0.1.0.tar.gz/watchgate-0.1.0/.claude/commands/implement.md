# Implementation Task

Implement the following using **TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle**:

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- â›” **ALL TESTS MUST PASS** - Run `pytest tests/` before completing ANY task
- â›” **NO TASK IS COMPLETE WITH FAILING TESTS** - This is non-negotiable
- ðŸ”´ **RED**: Write failing tests that define requirements first
- ðŸŸ¢ **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
- ðŸ”µ **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green

## Before Starting:
- **Flag any concerns** about inconsistencies, missing information, or unclear requirements
- **Ask questions** if anything is ambiguous or needs clarification
- **No backward compatibility needed** - this is pre-v0.1.0 release
