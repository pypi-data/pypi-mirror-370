# Compliance Platform Integration Requirements

## Overview

This document defines technical requirements for integrating Watchgate with enterprise compliance platforms to support SOX and other regulatory requirements. The integration will enable automated evidence collection, audit trail export, and compliance reporting through standardized APIs and data formats.

## Priority Compliance Platforms

### 1. AuditBoard with SOXHUB

**Platform Overview**: SOX lifecycle management platform with integrated evidence collection and testing workflows.

**API Integration Patterns**:
- REST API with OAuth 2.0 authentication
- GraphQL API for complex queries
- Webhook endpoints for real-time notifications
- Bulk data export via scheduled jobs

**Preferred Data Formats**:
- Primary: JSON (API native format)
- Secondary: CSV for bulk exports
- Evidence attachments: PDF, Excel, images
- Audit trail: Structured JSON with timestamps

**Authentication Methods**:
- OAuth 2.0 with client credentials flow
- API key authentication for service accounts
- JWT tokens for session management
- SAML integration for enterprise SSO

**Evidence Collection Workflows**:
```
1. Control Testing → Evidence Upload → Review → Approval
2. Automated Evidence → Validation → Archive → Reporting
3. Exception Handling → Investigation → Remediation → Documentation
```

**Integration Architecture**:
- Plugin: `AuditBoardConnector`
- Config: `auditboard` section in watchgate.yaml
- Transport: HTTPS with certificate pinning
- Retry logic: Exponential backoff with jitter
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute default

### 2. MetricStream

**Platform Overview**: Unified governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) platform with comprehensive control management.
