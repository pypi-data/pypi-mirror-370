# Secrets Filter Implementation Summary

**Feature**: Secrets Filter Plugin  
**Developer**: Watchgate Team

## What Was Built

Implemented a regex-based secrets detection and filtering plugin that identifies well-known credential patterns in MCP communications. Focuses on high-confidence detection to minimize false positives while providing configurable actions (block, redact, audit-only).

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. High-Confidence Patterns Only
**Decision**: Focus on secret formats with unique, unambiguous identifiers  
**Rationale**:
- Minimizes false positives in production
- Targets secrets with clear format markers (AKIA-, ghp_, etc.)
- Avoids generic patterns that match legitimate data
- Conservative approach builds trust for initial deployment

### 2. Modular Detection System
**Decision**: Enable/disable specific secret types individually  
**Rationale**:
- Organizations have different risk profiles
- Allows gradual rollout of detection types
- Reduces noise by disabling irrelevant detectors
- Easier troubleshooting of false positives

### 3. Conservative Entropy Detection
**Decision**: High thresholds for entropy-based unknown secret detection  
**Rationale**:
- Entropy detection has higher false positive risk
- High thresholds (5.5+) catch only very random strings
- Disabled by default, opt-in for security-conscious environments
- Balances security with usability

### 4. Allowlist for Development Patterns
**Decision**: Support allowlist patterns for testing/development scenarios  
**Rationale**:
- Development environments need test credentials
- Prevents blocking of placeholder secrets
- Supports CI/CD pipelines with known test patterns
- Reduces friction for legitimate development workflows

## Technical Approach

- **Pre-compiled Patterns**: Regex compilation at plugin initialization for performance
- **Priority-based Checking**: Check high-confidence patterns first
- **Boundary Anchoring**: Proper regex boundaries to avoid partial matches
- **Structured Metadata**: Detailed detection information for audit trail

## Implementation Patterns

- **Detection Type Registry**: Clean way to add new secret types
- **Configuration Validation**: Pydantic models ensure valid patterns
- **Exemption System**: Tool and path-based exemptions for trusted contexts
- **Action Flexibility**: Same detection logic supports multiple response actions

## Lessons for Future Security Plugins

1. **Start conservative, expand carefully** - False positives damage trust
2. **Make everything configurable** - Organizations have different needs
3. **Provide clear exemption paths** - Avoid blocking legitimate workflows
4. **Focus on proven patterns first** - Establish reliability before adding experimental detection
