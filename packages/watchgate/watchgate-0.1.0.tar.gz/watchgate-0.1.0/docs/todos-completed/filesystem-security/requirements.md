# Filesystem Server Security Plugin

**Status**: In Development

## Problem Statement
The modelcontextprotocol/servers/src/filesystem MCP server needs specialized security controls for path-based access control and file operation restrictions.

## Requirements
- Path-based access control with tool-specific permissions
- Glob pattern matching for paths
- Tool-specific path permissions matrix (read vs write vs admin operations)
- Blocked path patterns for sensitive files
- Integration with existing security architecture
- Comprehensive configuration validation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Path-based access control with glob patterns
- [ ] Tool-specific permissions (read_file, write_file, etc.)
- [ ] Blocked patterns for sensitive files (*.env, secrets/*)
- [ ] Integration with PolicyDecision architecture
- [ ] Configuration validation for filesystem tools
- [ ] Performance optimized pattern matching

## Constraints
- Must use pathspec library for glob pattern matching
- Tool names must validate against known filesystem server capabilities
- Pattern compilation should be optimized for runtime performance

## Configuration
```yaml
plugins:
  security:
    - policy: "filesystem_server_security"
      enabled: true
      priority: 20
      config:
        path_permissions:
          - paths: 
              - "public/**/*"
              - "docs/**/*.md"
            tools:
              - "read_file"
              - "list_directory"
          - paths:
              - "!**/*.env"
              - "!**/secrets/**"
            tools: []  # No tools allowed
```

## Implementation Notes
This feature is currently in development. The configuration schema and basic validation are implemented but the core security logic needs completion.
