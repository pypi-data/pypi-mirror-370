# Prompt Injection Defense Plugin

**Status**: Placeholder

## Problem Statement
Need to detect and block basic prompt injection techniques in MCP communications to prevent manipulation of AI systems.

## Requirements
- Detect common prompt injection patterns
- Support block, redact, audit_only modes
- Pattern-based detection for reliability
- Configurable sensitivity levels (standard, strict)
- Custom injection patterns via regex
- Tool exemptions for trusted tools
- Integration with audit trail

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Detects delimiter injection (triple quotes, code blocks)
- [ ] Detects basic role manipulation attempts
- [ ] Detects context breaking keywords
- [ ] Configurable sensitivity levels
- [ ] Custom pattern support
- [ ] Tool exemption system
- [ ] Audit integration with detailed metadata

## Constraints
- Pattern-based detection for v0.1.0 (no ML)
- Must balance security with usability
- Performance target: <50ms per request
- Focus on high-confidence detection patterns

## Configuration
```yaml
plugins:
  security:
    - policy: "basic_prompt_injection_defense"
      enabled: true
      priority: 15
      config:
        action: "block"  # or "audit_only"
        sensitivity: "standard"  # standard, strict
        detection_methods:
          delimiter_injection:
            enabled: true
          role_manipulation:
            enabled: true
          context_breaking:
            enabled: true
        exemptions:
          tools: ["trusted_tool"]
```

## Implementation Notes
This is a placeholder for future implementation. The plugin interface and configuration structure are defined but the detection logic needs to be implemented.
