# Notification Support Feature

## Overview
MCP supports notification messages in addition to request/response. Notifications are one-way messages that don't expect a response. Claude Desktop and other MCP clients send notifications like `notifications/initialized` after connecting.

## Requirements
- Support receiving notifications from MCP clients
- Support forwarding notifications to upstream MCP servers
- Support sending notifications from upstream servers back to clients
- Validate notification messages according to JSON-RPC 2.0 spec
- Allow plugins to process notifications (for auditing, filtering, etc.)

## Technical Details
According to JSON-RPC 2.0 specification:
- Notifications are requests without an "id" field
- They don't expect a response
- Common MCP notifications include:
  - `notifications/initialized` - Sent by client after receiving initialize response
  - `notifications/cancelled` - Sent to cancel an in-progress request
  - `notifications/progress` - Progress updates for long-running operations

## Implementation Notes
- The `MCPNotification` class already exists in our protocol.messages module
- Need to update validation, transport, and server components to handle notifications
- Notifications should flow through the plugin pipeline similar to requests

## Status
In Progress - Implementing to fix Claude Desktop compatibility issue
