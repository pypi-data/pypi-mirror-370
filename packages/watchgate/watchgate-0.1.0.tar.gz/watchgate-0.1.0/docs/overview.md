# Watchgate Requirements Overview

*Version: 1.2*  
*Status: Active*

## Project Overview

Watchgate is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) security proxy that provides auditing, logging, and access control for MCP client-server communications. This document provides a high-level overview of Watchgate's requirements across all versions and releases.

## Mission Statement

To provide developers with secure, auditable, and manageable MCP deployments through a transparent security proxy that maintains full compatibility with the MCP specification while adding essential security and monitoring capabilities.

## Core Principles

1. **Security by Design** - All MCP communications are secured and audited by default
2. **Zero Trust Architecture** - All tool access requires explicit authorization
3. **Full Transparency** - Complete audit trails for all agent-tool interactions
4. **MCP Compatibility** - Maintains full compatibility with MCP specification
5. **Minimal Complexity** - Simple setup and configuration for immediate value

## User Documentation

Watchgate provides comprehensive documentation organized by user journey:

- **[Getting Started](user/getting-started/)** - Installation and initial setup
- **[Core Concepts](user/core-concepts/)** - Understanding Watchgate's architecture and security model
- **[Tutorials](user/tutorials/)** - Practical guides for common security scenarios
- **[Reference](user/reference/)** - Technical documentation and troubleshooting
- **[Contributing](user/contribute/)** - How to provide feedback and contribute

## Quick Start

New to Watchgate? Start here:

1. **[Install Watchgate](user/getting-started/installation.md)** - Get up and running
2. **[Basic Setup](user/getting-started/quick-setup.md)** - Configure your first security policy
3. **[Secure Tool Access](user/tutorials/securing-tool-access.md)** - Implement tool access control

For developers and architects, see the [Requirements Overview](#project-overview) below.

## Target Users

- **Individual Developers** - Experimenting with MCP and needing basic security
- **Small Teams** - Deploying AI agents with shared tool access
- **Enterprise Users** - Requiring audit trails and access controls for compliance
- **Security Researchers** - Analyzing agent behavior and tool usage patterns

## Release Strategy

### Version 0.1.0 - Initial Release
**Status: Complete**  
**Focus: Core security functionality with minimal complexity**

- [Version 0.1.0 Requirements](versions/v0.1.0/v0.1.0-requirements.md) - Detailed requirements for initial release
- [v0.1.0 Implementation Plan](versions/v0.1.0/v0.1.0-implementation-plan.md) - Implementation strategy and components

## Architecture Overview

Watchgate implements a transparent proxy architecture that sits between MCP clients and servers:

```
[MCP Client] ↔ [Watchgate Proxy] ↔ [MCP Server/Tools]
                      ↓
                [Audit System]
                [Policy Engine]
```

## Core Components

1. **MCP Gateway Server** - Transparent message relay with security checks
2. **Plugin-Based Architecture** - Flexible, policy-based plugin system with discovery and sequencing
3. **Policy Engine** - Access control and authorization rules with response filtering
4. **Audit System** - Comprehensive logging and monitoring with detailed filtering information
5. **Configuration Management** - Dynamic policy and setting updates with YAML-based plugin configuration
6. **Enhanced Message Types** - JSON-RPC 2.0 request/response handling

## Plugin System Architecture

Watchgate implements a modern plugin-based architecture for maximum flexibility:

### Plugin Discovery and Configuration
- **Policy-Based Loading**: Plugins are automatically discovered and configured by policy name
- **YAML Configuration**: Simple, declarative plugin configuration format

### Plugin Execution Model
- **Sequential Processing**: Plugins execute in a deterministic order
- **Priority System**: Configurable execution priority (lower numbers = higher priority)
- **Request/Response Modification**: Plugins can modify requests and responses in addition to allowing/blocking requests

### Built-in Plugins
- **Tool Allowlist Plugin**: Consistent tool filtering for both execution and discovery
- **File Auditing Plugin**: Comprehensive audit logging with configurable formats
- **Extensible Interface**: Clear plugin development interface for custom security policies
