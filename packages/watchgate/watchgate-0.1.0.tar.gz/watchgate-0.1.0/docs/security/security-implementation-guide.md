# Watchgate Security Guide

## What This Guide Covers

If you're evaluating Watchgate as a security layer for your MCP (Model Context Protocol) setup, this guide will help you understand:
- How Watchgate protects your AI tool interactions
- What security capabilities come built-in
- When you might need additional third-party security tools
- How to make informed decisions about your security configuration

## Understanding Watchgate's Security Model

### The Basic Concept

Think of Watchgate as a security checkpoint between your AI client (like Claude Desktop) and the tools it can access. Every request and response flows through Watchgate's security plugins, which can:

- **Block** dangerous requests before they reach tools
- **Redact** sensitive information from responses
- **Alert** you to suspicious activity
- **Log** everything for audit trails

```
AI Client → [Watchgate Security Layer] → MCP Tools/Servers
           ↑ Your configurable protection ↑
```

### How Security Plugins Work

Watchgate uses a plugin pipeline - each security check runs independently but in sequence. This modular approach means:

1. **You control what's checked** - Enable only the plugins relevant to your needs
2. **Each plugin has one job** - Secrets detection, PII filtering, prompt injection prevention
3. **Failures are safe** - If a plugin crashes, Watchgate blocks the request rather than letting it through
4. **Performance scales** - Plugins run efficiently in sequence with early exits

## Built-in Security Capabilities

### What Comes Out of the Box

Watchgate ships with three primary security plugins:

#### 1. Secrets Detection Plugin
**Purpose**: Prevents accidental exposure of API keys, tokens, and credentials

**Strengths**:
- Detects common patterns (AWS keys, GitHub tokens, JWT tokens)
- Base64-decodes and scans encoded secrets (with DoS protection)
- Uses entropy analysis to catch random-looking secrets
- Minimal false positives after recent improvements

**Limitations**:
- Won't catch custom or proprietary credential formats
- Limited to base64 encoding (no ROT13, custom obfuscation)
- May miss secrets split across multiple messages

#### 2. PII (Personal Information) Filter
**Purpose**: Protects personally identifiable information from exposure

**Strengths**:
- Covers common PII types (SSN, credit cards, emails, phone numbers)
- Can redact or block based on your preference
- Format-aware (e.g., only flags properly formatted SSNs, not random 9-digit numbers)

**Limitations**:
- Limited geographic coverage (US/UK/Canada for IDs, US/UK/International for phones)
- Won't catch contextual PII (e.g., "John's address is...")
- No semantic understanding of information sensitivity

#### 3. Prompt Injection Prevention
**Purpose**: Blocks attempts to manipulate AI behavior through crafted inputs

**Strengths**:
- Detects common injection patterns
- Checks for encoded/obfuscated attacks
- Continuously updated pattern matching

**Limitations**:
- Can't catch novel or sophisticated attacks
- May flag legitimate security discussions
- No understanding of actual intent

### A Solid Start

These built-in plugins provide a solid foundation, but they're pattern-based, not intelligence-based. They excel at catching known threats but won't understand context or intent. Think of them as automated guards checking for specific red flags, not security experts making nuanced decisions.

## When to Consider Third-Party Security Tools

### Signs You Need More

Consider integrating additional security tools when:

1. **Regulatory Compliance** - You need to meet specific standards (HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2)
2. **Custom Threat Models** - Your organization faces unique risks
3. **Advanced Detection** - You need ML-based or behavioral analysis
4. **Geographic Specificity** - You handle data from regions not well-covered
5. **Industry Requirements** - Financial, healthcare, or government sectors

### How to Extend Security Capabilities

Watchgate's plugin architecture is designed for extensibility. You write custom security plugins to add whatever capabilities you need:

**Custom Security Plugin Examples**

For integrating third-party tools:
```python
class ThirdPartySecurityPlugin(SecurityPlugin):
    async def check_request(self, request):
        # Call external security API
        result = await security_api.scan(request)
        return PolicyDecision(allowed=result.safe)
```

For organization-specific patterns:
```python
class CompanySecurityPlugin(SecurityPlugin):
    async def check_request(self, request):
        # Check for internal policy violations
        if self.contains_internal_project_names(request):
            return PolicyDecision(allowed=False, reason="Internal project name detected")
        return PolicyDecision(allowed=True)
```

For advanced detection logic:
```python
class BehavioralSecurityPlugin(SecurityPlugin):
    async def check_request(self, request):
        # Implement custom ML model or heuristics
        risk_score = self.calculate_risk_score(request)
        if risk_score > self.threshold:
            return PolicyDecision(allowed=False, reason=f"High risk score: {risk_score}")
        return PolicyDecision(allowed=True)
```

This plugin approach gives you:
- Full control over security logic
- Access to complete request/response context
- Integration with any external service or API
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Easy enable/disable through configuration

## Making Configuration Decisions

### Start Conservative, Then Tune

Begin with a restrictive setup and relax as you understand your actual needs:

```yaml
# Conservative starting configuration
plugins:
  - type: security.secrets
    config:
      action: block  # Start with blocking
      secret_types:
        all: {enabled: true}  # Enable everything initially
      
  - type: security.pii
    config:
      action: redact  # Safer than blocking for PII
      pii_types:
        all: {enabled: true}
```

### Questions to Guide Your Configuration

#### For Secrets Detection:
- What types of credentials does your team use?
- How sensitive is accidental key exposure in your environment?
- Do you have secret rotation capabilities if something leaks?

#### For PII Protection:
- What regulations apply to your data?
- Should PII be blocked entirely or just redacted?
- What geographic regions do you serve?

#### For Prompt Injection:
- How much do you trust your users?
- Are you exposed to external/untrusted inputs?
- Can you tolerate some false positives for better protection?

### Performance vs Security Trade-offs

Each enabled plugin adds processing time (typically 10-50ms). Consider:

- **High-throughput systems**: Be selective about which plugins to enable
- **High-security environments**: Accept the performance cost for comprehensive checking
- **Development vs Production**: May want different configurations for each

## Understanding Limitations

### What Watchgate Can't Do

Be realistic about the protection level:

1. **No Perfect Security** - Determined attackers can find ways around pattern-based detection
2. **No Business Logic** - Can't understand if an action makes sense in context
3. **No Learning** - Doesn't adapt to new threats without updates
4. **No Replay Protection** - Doesn't prevent replay attacks or session hijacking
5. **No Encryption** - Doesn't add encryption to the MCP protocol itself

### Security Theater vs Real Protection

Watchgate provides real, measurable protection against:
- Accidental data exposure
- Known attack patterns
- Common security mistakes

It's not security theater, but it's also not a complete security solution. Think of it as one important layer in a defense-in-depth strategy.

## Practical Recommendations

### For Development Teams

1. **Start with the basics** - Enable secrets and PII detection
2. **Monitor false positives** - Tune configurations based on actual usage
3. **Regular updates** - Keep Watchgate updated for new patterns
4. **Test your setup** - Deliberately try to leak secrets to verify protection

### For Security Teams

1. **Audit everything** - Enable comprehensive logging
2. **Integrate with SIEM** - Feed Watchgate logs into your security monitoring
3. **Custom patterns** - Add organization-specific detection rules
4. **Regular reviews** - Analyze blocked requests to improve configurations

### For Compliance Officers

1. **Document configuration** - Maintain records of what's enabled and why
2. **Audit trails** - Ensure logging meets retention requirements
3. **Regular testing** - Demonstrate effectiveness through penetration testing
4. **Gap analysis** - Identify where additional tools are needed

## The Bottom Line

Watchgate's security plugin system offers:

**Strengths**:
- Immediate, out-of-box protection
- Configurable to your risk tolerance
- Transparent operation you can audit
- Low overhead when properly configured
- Open architecture for extensions

**Weaknesses**:
- Pattern-based, not intelligent
