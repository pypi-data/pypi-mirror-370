# v0.1.0 Historical Documentation

This directory contains the original version-based planning documents for Watchgate v0.1.0. These documents are archived for historical reference.

## Contents

- `v0.1.0-requirements.md` - Original comprehensive requirements document
- `v0.1.0-implementation-plan.md` - Deleted (implementation is in the code)
- `v0.1.0-test-plan.md` - Deleted (tests are the plan)

## Migration to Feature-Based Approach

As of the workflow transformation, Watchgate has moved to a feature-based development approach. Individual features are now documented in `docs/features/` with:

- Focused requirements per feature
- Implementation notes captured during development
- Decision records for significant choices
- Post-implementation summaries

This approach provides better flexibility and reduces the overhead of upfront planning while maintaining good documentation practices.

## Historical Context

The v0.1.0 release successfully delivered:
- Plugin-based architecture
- Core proxy functionality
- Security plugin suite (PII Filter, Secrets Filter)
- Auditing system
