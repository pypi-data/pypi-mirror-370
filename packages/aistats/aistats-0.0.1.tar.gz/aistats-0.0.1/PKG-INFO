## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Descriptive Statistics**  
  - Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, Skewness, Kurtosis  

- 📈 **Inferential Statistics**  
  - Hypothesis Testing (t-test, chi-square, ANOVA, etc.)  
  - Confidence Intervals  
  - Correlation & Regression  

- 🧠 **AI + Machine Learning**  
  - Linear & Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Trees, Random Forest  
  - Neural Network-based estimations
