======================================================================

Version 0.1 (2012-05-20) :
  First public release. Features include :
    - computation of Dirichlet domains for the norm one group in an order of a Fuchsian or Kleinian quaternion algebra.
    - computation of a presentation for this group, and expression of any element as a word in the generators.
    - production of Maple code for graphic output of the fundamental polyhedron.

Version 1.0 (2012-09-25) :
    Bugfixes :
        - when computing the same group with different centers, only the first center was used
        - fixed an infinite loop when computing Bianchi groups
    New features :
        - computation of the unit group and the maximal group (normalizer of the order)
        - lift of the presentation from the group modulo center to the full group (norm one and units)
        - computation of the systole (slow)
        - more examples and (hopefully) simpler use
        - various optimizations
