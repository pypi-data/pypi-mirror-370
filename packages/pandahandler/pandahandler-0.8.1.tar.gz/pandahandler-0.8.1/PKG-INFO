# pandahandler

Tools to simplify working with pandas objects DataFrame and Series. See [the docs](https://pandahandler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Installation:
- We're [on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pandahandler/), so `pip install pandahandler`.
- Consider using the [simplest-possible virtual environment](https://gist.github.com/zkurtz/4c61572b03e667a7596a607706463543) if working directly on this repo.

pandahandler is a staging area for experimental tooling that could eventually be added to pandas itself. If that were to happen with any of these tools, we would remove them from this package after adding a deprecation notice and migration notes etc.
