Usage
=====

Instructions for Creating FSM Orders from Point of Sale
=======================================================

1. Create or Edit a Product
---------------------------

Configure the product to create an FSM order per sale and add it to the
Point of Sale (POS).

2. Configure Stock Update Behavior
----------------------------------

In the POS settings, you can choose how stock updates:

- **Real-time**: FSM orders and pickings will be linked immediately.
- **On session close**: FSM orders and pickings will be linked only when
  the POS session is closed.

3. Configure the user who will recive notifications on fsm order creation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the POS settings, under Sale Order Creation you can set the person
who will recive notifications to review the orders and assign them.

4. Open a New Point of Sale Session
-----------------------------------

5. Add the Configured Product to the Order
------------------------------------------

6. Select a Customer
--------------------

7. Click on "Create Order"
--------------------------

8. Behavior Based on the Selected Option
----------------------------------------

Create Draft Sale Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A draft Sale Order will be created.
- To process it, go to **Quotations/Orders**, select the order, and
  confirm it.
- **Real-time stock**: An FSM order will be created and linked
  immediately to the pickings.
- **Non-real-time stock**: You will need to close the POS session to
  link the FSM order to the pickings.

Create Confirmed Sale Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A confirmed Sale Order will be created directly.
- This flow works the same whether stock updates are real-time or not.
- An FSM order will be created and linked to the Sale Order
  automatically.

Create Delivered/Invoiced Sale Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- These options will automatically complete both the FSM order and the
  associated pickings.
- The difference between them is that **Invoiced** will also generate an
  invoice.

--------------

Refunds
=======

Refunds can be processed directly from the POS. The behavior varies
depending on whether it is a full or partial refund:

Full Refunds
------------

- If the FSM order is not yet completed, it will be canceled.

Partial Refunds
---------------

- The picking will be updated by removing the refunded products.
