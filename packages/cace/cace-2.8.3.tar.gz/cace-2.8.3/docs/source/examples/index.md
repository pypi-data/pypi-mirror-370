# Examples

The following repositories contain example circuit designs, each having a `cace/` subdirectory with a specification input (the datasheet), and a set of testbench schematics which are used by CACE to measure all specified parameters, generate results, and analyze them to determine circuit performance over corners.

Example circuit repositories:

| Design                     | Description                | PDK |
