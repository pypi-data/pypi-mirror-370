Use Cases / Context
===================

When a call-off order is confirmed for a product, the priority date used
to compute the quantity available at promised date must be the start
date of the blanket order.

This is required to ensure that the principle of first-come,
first-served is respected. In the case of a product part of a blanket
order the date to consider must be the start date of the blanket order
and not the date of the call-off order.
