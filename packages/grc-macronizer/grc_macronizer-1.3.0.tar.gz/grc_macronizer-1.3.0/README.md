# A Macronizer for Ancient Greek

<img src="docs/media/macronizer.gif" width="300">

A macronizer geared towards batch macronizing corpora with machine-friendly markup, avoiding combining diacritics and everything that doesn't render in standard IDE and terminal fonts unless specifically asked for.

*Installation:*
- Create a virtual environment with Python 3.12. Nothing will work if you don't get this step right!
- After having initialized your venv, activate it and install the right version of spaCy, the dependency of odyCy, with `pip install spacy>=3.7.4,<3.8.0`.
- Navigate to `external/grc_odycy_joint_trf` and install odyCy locally with `pip install grc_odycy_joint_trf`, while making sure that you are still in the venv with Python 3.12 you created earlier. 
- Install the submodule `grc-utils` with `cd grc-utils` and `pip install .`.

And that's it! Start macronizing by running the notebook [here](macronize.ipynb).

If you have a plain text file you want to macronize, you can run it with `python main.py input_file output_file`.

Note that if you have a newer spaCy pipeline for Ancient Greek, it is easy to substitute it for odyCy. Indeed, the rest of the software has no legacy dependencies and should run with the latest python.
