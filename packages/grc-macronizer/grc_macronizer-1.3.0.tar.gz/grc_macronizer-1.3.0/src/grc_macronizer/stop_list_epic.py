'''
This file contains some of the words whose dichrona are regularly both long and short in epic poetry.
Some of them were explicitly prolonged or shortened to fit the metre, some of them were so old and arcane that their prosody was not known to the author.

Hellenistic poets in particular took great pleasure in lines containing the same word with alternating prosody.
So Callimachus 1.55:
    κα_λὰ^ μὲν ἠέξευ, κα^λὰ^ δ' ἔτραφες, οὐράνιε Ζεῦ

NOTE: the Hypotactic database in particular is "contaminated" by Homer, and so if you run with Hypotactic it is likely that you will get Homeric oddities without this stop list.
