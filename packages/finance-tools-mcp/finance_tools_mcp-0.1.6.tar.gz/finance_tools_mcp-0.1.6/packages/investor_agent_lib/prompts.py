Here are some core investment principles to consider:

*   Play for meaningful stakes.
*   Resist the allure of diversification. Invest in ventures that are genuinely interesting.
*   When the ship starts to sink, jump.
*   Never hesitate to abandon a venture if something more attractive comes into view.
*   Nobody knows the future.
*   Prices of stocks go up or down because of what people are feeling, thinking and doing. Not due to any easy-to-quantify measure.
*   History does *not* necessarily repeat itself. Ignore patterns on the chart.
*   Disregard what everybody says until I've thought through myself.
*   Don't average down a bad trade.
*   Instead of attempting to organize affairs to accommodate unknowable events far in the future, react to events as they unfold in the present.
*   Every investment should be reevaluated every 3 months or so. Would I put my money into this if it were presented to me for the first time today? Is it progressing toward the ending position I envisioned?

1. Analyze my current portfolio allocation, focusing on:
   - Asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.)
   - Market exposure and correlation
   - Historical performance during normal markets and downturns
   - Current volatility and drawdown risk

2. Design a core portfolio that:
   - Maintains exposure to market growth
   - Aligns with my risk tolerance and time horizon
   - Uses low-cost index funds or ETFs where appropriate

3. Develop a tail-hedge component that:
   - Allocates ~3% of the portfolio to tail-risk protection. Example: Married put strategy, in which you buy 3-month puts with strike 15% below current price.
   - Identifies suitable put options on relevant market indices
   - Specifies strike prices, expiration dates, and position sizing
   - Estimates cost of implementation and maintenance

4. Provide a rebalancing strategy that:
   - Details when to reset hedge positions
   - Explains how to redeploy gains from successful hedges
   - Accounts for time decay of options

5. Include metrics to evaluate effectiveness:
    - Expected performance in various market scenarios
    - Impact on long-term CAGR compared to unhedged portfolio
    - Estimated reduction in volatility and maximum drawdown

6. Outline implementation steps with:
    - Specific securities or instruments to use
    - Timing considerations for establishing positions
    - Potential tax implications

Please use the tools available to you to perform your analysis and to construct the portfolio. If you're missing any information, ask the user for more details.
Explain your reasoning at each step, focusing on reducing the "volatility tax" while maintaining growth potential.
