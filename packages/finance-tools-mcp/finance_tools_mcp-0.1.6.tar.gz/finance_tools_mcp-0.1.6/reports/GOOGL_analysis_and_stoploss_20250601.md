## 6. Investment Recommendation

Based on the comprehensive CAN SLIM analysis, Google (GOOGL) presents a strong investment case. The company excels in current and annual earnings growth (C & A), holds a clear leadership position (L), and shows positive supply/demand dynamics in its stock (S). New product developments in AI and Waymo offer further catalysts (N).

While not currently at a new 52-week high, and facing some regulatory headwinds (N) and mixed recent institutional buying (I), the overall picture is favorable. The valuation appears reasonable compared to peers.

**Recommendation: Selectively add to your Google position.**
*   Consider an initial partial addition at current levels.
*   Monitor for potential short-term pullbacks (e.g., towards $170.75, $169.25, or the 20-day SMA around $164.53) for further additions, provided the uptrend remains intact.
*   Stay informed on antitrust developments and AI competition.

## 7. Stop-Loss Strategy

For new additions, consider a stop-loss to manage risk. Based on current technicals:
*   **Recommended Stop-Loss Level:** Around **$162.50**.
    *   This is below the recent swing low of $162.90 (2025-05-20) and the 20-day SMA (~$164.53).
    *   Represents a potential risk of ~5.4% from the current price of $171.74.
*   **Alternative Tighter Stop:** Around $163.90 (below 20-day SMA, ~4.6% risk).
*   **Alternative Wider Stop:** Around $159.50 (below 50-day SMA, ~7.1% risk).

Adjust position size according to your chosen stop-loss to align with your risk management plan.
