# scmorph - Single-cell morphological analysis

scmorph is a **Python library** to process **CellPainting** or any
morphological data. It unlocks single-cell data to model heterogenity.

scmorph differs from the popular
[PyCytominer](https://github.com/cytomining/pycytominer) package in the
following ways:

-   **Single-cell**: Enables efficient analysis of single-cell data
-   **Batch-correction**: Natively integrates a [batch correction
    technique](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2019.03.010) widely used
    for scRNA-seq.
-   **Enhanced feature selection**: Removes non-linearly correlated
    features using an adapted [Chatterjee correlation
    coefficient](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2108.06828), which
    results in fewer, more meaningful features.
-   **Enhanced aggregation**: Offers statistically robust aggregation
    methods to derive meaningful distances to a control sample.

It provides tools to make single-cell data analysis easier and more
reproducible. For example, it can be used to:

-   Load in data from csv files, e.g. generated by CellProfiler.
-   Remove batch effects to compare conditions across batches.
-   QC both cells and images.
-   Remove redundant features based on correlation.
-   Reduce dimensionality to gain quick intuition about the data\'s
    spread.
-   Perform statistically robust aggregate analysis to quickly identify
    hits.
