    """
    Filter outlier observations from an AnnData object.

    Note
    ----------
    The `outliers` argument determines how many cells will be classified as outlier cells.
    Since it is an arbitrary threshold this will depend on your dataset and downstream analysis.
    We encourage you to try different values and see which one works best for your dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        Annotated data matrix.
    outliers
        Expected fraction of outlier cells.
    fraction
        During training, subsample to this `fraction` of the number of observations.
    n_obs
        During training, subsample to this number of observations.
        We recommend 10,000 or fewer, as this results in faster training with adequate accuracy.
    n_cores
        Number of cores to use for parallelization. -1 for all cores.
    only_detect
        Whether to only detect outliers but not filter them.
