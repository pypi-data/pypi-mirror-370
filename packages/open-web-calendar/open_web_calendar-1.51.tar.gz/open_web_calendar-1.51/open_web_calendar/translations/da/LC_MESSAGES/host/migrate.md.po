msgid "Move Your Calendars to Another Server"

msgid ""
"The Open Web Calendar does not need a database and does not save data about "
"your calendars. Thus it is easy to change the location of the calendar host "
"to another server."
msgstr ""

msgid "You might migrate out of these reasons:"
msgstr ""

msgid "You use the hosted version but you have set up your own server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You would like to use the Open Web Calendar behind a firewall or as a local "
"service."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You made modifications to the Open Web Calendar that are not yet in this "
"repository."

"Moving the calendar requires you to edit the URL that is used. This is an "
"example URL that you would use to display or link to the calendar:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**https://open-web-"
"calendar.hosted.quelltext.eu**/calendar.html?language=de&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.co.uk%2Fcalendar.ics"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You only need to replace the **bold** part of the calendar with the new "
"server location. If your server runs with a [local development "
"setup](../../dev) at `http://localhost:8000`, you would migrate your "
"calendar by editing the URL, leaving everything behind the first `/` as it "
"is:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**http://localhost:8000**/calendar.html?language=de&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.co.uk%2Fcalendar.ics"

"features as is."

"**Downgrading** - moving to an earlier version of the Open Web Calendar - "
"should generally work without total loss as new configuration parameters are"
