# Self-Hosting & Deployment

You do not have to host the Open Web Calendar yourself but you are encouraged to.
It is intended to work behind a company firewall, through a proxy and also without access to the Internet.

Several hosting options are already documented.
We are grateful if you can add your favorite one, too.

1. **Choose a hoster.** These are listed below.
2. [**Read about Configuration**](../configure).

## Vercel

You can create a fork of this repository which automatically deploys to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fniccokunzmann%2Fopen-web-calendar.git)

Alternatively you can create a one off deploy by cloning this repository and running `npx vercel` at the root.

## Heroku

You can deploy the app using [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
