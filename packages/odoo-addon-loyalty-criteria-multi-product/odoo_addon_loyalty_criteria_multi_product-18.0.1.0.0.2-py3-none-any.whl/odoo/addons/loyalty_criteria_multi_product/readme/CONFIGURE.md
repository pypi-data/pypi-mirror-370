To configure multiple product criterias:

1.  Go to *Sales \> Product \> Loyalty Programs* and select or create a
    new one.
2.  Go to rules. On the *Loyalty Criteria* field choose *Multi Product*.
3.  The standard domain will be hidden and a criteria list will be
    shown.
4.  Add as many criterias as needed for the desired promotion behavior.

In the list of criterias we can configure:

- Products: The products that should be present to fulfill the
  condition.

Some examples:

[TABLE]

A unit of Product A must be in the sale order.

[TABLE]

A unit of Product B and Product C must be in the sale order.

Also note that all the defined criterias must be fulfilled or the
program won't be applied.
