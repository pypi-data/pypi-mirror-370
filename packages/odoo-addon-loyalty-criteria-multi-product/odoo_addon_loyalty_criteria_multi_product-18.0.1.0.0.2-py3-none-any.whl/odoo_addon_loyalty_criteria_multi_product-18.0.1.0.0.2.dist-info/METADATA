Base module that allows to define complex rules on products to fulfill
the conditions of a loyalty program, so for a given set of products we
could define a minimum quantity and another for others, being all those
criterias mandatory for the program to be applied.

Use Cases / Context
===================

The functionality of the "Repeat" option that was included in this
module is now included in the rules of an odoo promotion. In this
functionality a criterion was established in which any of the products
defined in the list of the criterion itself had to be in the sales order
lines in the minimum quantity established for the promotion to be
applied. This functionality can now be applied in the following way:

- Defining or editing a promotion.
- Modifying the rules to indicate a minimum quantity and selecting the
  products, either by domain, specific products, product category or
  tag.

This way the promotion will be applicable when any of those products are
in the order l ines and the total of all or one of them meets the
minimum quantity, as it was done when the "Repeat" option was checked.

Configuration
=============

To configure multiple product criterias:

1. Go to *Sales > Product > Loyalty Programs* and select or create a new
   one.
2. Go to rules. On the *Loyalty Criteria* field choose *Multi Product*.
3. The standard domain will be hidden and a criteria list will be shown.
4. Add as many criterias as needed for the desired promotion behavior.

In the list of criterias we can configure:

- Products: The products that should be present to fulfill the
  condition.

Some examples:

[TABLE]

A unit of Product A must be in the sale order.

[TABLE]

A unit of Product B and Product C must be in the sale order.

Also note that all the defined criterias must be fulfilled or the
program won't be applied.
