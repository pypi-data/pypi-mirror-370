TAX Report is a report that displays transactions based on the selected
tax type within a specific date range (period). It helps businesses
track VAT and Withholding Tax more accurately, and supports both
standard and Revenue Department (RD) formats for compliance purposes.
The module also allows customization of report formats and text files
for official tax submissions.
