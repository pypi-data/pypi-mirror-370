TAX Report is a report that displays transactions based on the selected tax type within a specific date range (period).
It helps businesses track VAT and Withholding Tax more accurately, and supports both standard and Revenue Department (RD) formats for compliance purposes.
The module also allows customization of report formats and text files for official tax submissions.
