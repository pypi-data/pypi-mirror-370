===================
Accessing DCOR data
===================

The `deformability cytometry open repository (DCOR)
<https://dcor.mpl.mpg.de>`_ allows you to upload and access RT-DC
datasets online (internet connection required). In DCscope, you
can access parts of the dataset (e.g. just two features) without
downloading the entire data file (which includes image, contour, and
traces information). This saves disk space and time when accessing
large datasets.
