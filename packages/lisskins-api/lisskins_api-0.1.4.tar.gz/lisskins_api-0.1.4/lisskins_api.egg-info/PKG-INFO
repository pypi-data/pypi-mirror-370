## ▌ Asynchronous Module for Interacting with the Lis Skins API

This project is an asynchronous Python module designed to facilitate interaction with the LIS Skins API. The module allows users to retrieve account balances, purchase skins, view their purchase histories, withdraw unlocked skins, and return locked ones, perform all actions that Lis Skins API allows. 

> Current API documentation can be found [here](https://lis-skins.stoplight.io/docs/lis-skins/)

```
from lisskins_api import LisSkinsAPIClient


async def main():
    client = LisSkinsAPIClient('<api_key>')

    # Get account balance
    balance = await client.user_balance()

    # Search skin to buy
    search_skins = await client.search_skins(
        'csgo', price_from=1, price_to=10, float_from=0.9, sort_by='lowest_price',
        only_unlocked=1, names=['Glock-18 | Bullet Queen (Battle-Scarred)']
    )

    # Buy a skin
    buy_skin = await client.buy_skin(
        item_ids=[240978929], partner='<part of trade link>', token='<part of trade link>'
    )

    # Check status purchased skin 
    purchased_skin_info = await client.purchased_skins_info(purchase_ids=[39999999])

    # Withdraw a skin
    withdraw_skin = await client.withdraw_skins_from_specific_purchase(purchase_id=39999999)
