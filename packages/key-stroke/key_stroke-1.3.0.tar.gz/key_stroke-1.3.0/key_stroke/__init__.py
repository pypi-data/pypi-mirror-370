key_stroke - The python loop key pressed interupt module

key_stroke is a small module to quit/terminate a loop of a console app
by simply pressing a key. The beauty is that this module is running on Linux,
Ã–pfel-Rechnern as well Fenster operated computers.

Have fun while using the key_stroke module!
