# Grummage

Grype + Rummage = Grummage.

Grummage is an interactive terminal frontend to [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype).

![A short video showing Grummage](./grummage.gif)

## Introduction

[Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) is an awesome vulnerability scanner. It produces minimal textual output, or verbose JSON files. I wanted something to rummage around in the json, without having to learn arcane jq syntax ;).

So Grummage was born.

## Installation

Grummage is written in Python and requires Python 3.8 or later.

### Pre-requisites

Grummage requires the [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) binary in your path to function.

You may want to confirm the Grype command line works, and has updated the vulnerability database first.

```shell
grype --version
```

```
grype 0.84.0
```

```shell
grype db update
```

```
  ✔ Vulnerability DB                [no update available]
 No vulnerability database update available
```

### From PyPI (Recommended)

The easiest way to install grummage is from PyPI:

```shell
pip install grummage
```

### From GitHub Releases

Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/popey/grummage/releases).

### Using Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```shell
brew tap popey/grummage
brew install grummage
```

### Using Docker

Note: `-it` is required for interaction with the application. Setting the `TERM` variable allows for better colour support.

```shell
docker run --rm -it -e TERM=xterm-256color -v $(pwd):/data ghcr.io/popey/grummage:latest /data/your-sbom.json
```

### Using Snap

```shell
sudo snap install grummage
```

### From Source

For development or if you prefer to install from source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/popey/grummage
cd grummage
pip install -e .
```

### Using uv (Alternative)

If you use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python environment management:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/popey/grummage
cd grummage
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Point grummage at an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials):

```shell
grummage ./example_sboms/nextcloud-latest-syft-sbom.json
```

Grummage will load the SBOM and pass it through Grype to build the vulnerability list. 
Use the cursor keys or mouse to navigate the tree on the left pane.
Press Enter or mouse click on a vulnerability to obtain limited details.

### Keys:

* `e` - Request further details via `grype explain`
* `q` - Quit

Sort by:

* `n` - Name of package
* `v` - Vulnerability ID
* `t` - Type of package
* `s` - Severity of issue

## Making SBOMs

I use [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) to generate SBOMs, but other tools are available. For example:

```shell
syft nextcloud:latest -o syft-json=nextcloud-latest-syft-sbom.json
```

```
 ✔ Loaded image       nextcloud:latest
 ✔ Parsed image       sha256:44c884988b43e01e1434a66f58943dc809a193abf1a6df0f2cebad450e587ad7

   ├── ✔ Packages                        [418 packages]
   ├── ✔ File digests                    [10,605 files]
   ├── ✔ File metadata                   [10,605 locations]
   └── ✔ Executables                     [1,317 executables]
```

## Distribution

Grummage is available through multiple distribution channels:

- **PyPI**: `pip install grummage`
- **Homebrew**: `brew tap popey/grummage && brew install grummage`
- **Docker**: `ghcr.io/popey/grummage:latest`
- **Snap**: `sudo snap install grummage`
- **GitHub Releases**: Pre-built packages available

## Caveats

I am an open-source enthusiast and self-taught coder creating projects driven by curiosity and a love for problem-solving. The code may have bugs or sharp edges. Kindly let me know if you find one, via an [issue](https://github.com/popey/grummage/issues). Thanks.
