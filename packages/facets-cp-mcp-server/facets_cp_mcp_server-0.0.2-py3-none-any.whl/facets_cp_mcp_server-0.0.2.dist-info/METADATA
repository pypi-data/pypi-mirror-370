# Facets Control Plane MCP Server

This MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server provides comprehensive tools for interacting with the Facets Control Plane REST API. It enables seamless management of projects, resources, environments, and deployments through Claude, offering secure and robust infrastructure automation workflows.

## Key Features

* **Complete Project Management**  
  Full lifecycle project management including project discovery, variable management, and resource configuration with built-in validation and safety checks.

* **Resource Lifecycle Management**  
  End-to-end resource management from discovery and creation to updates and deletion. Supports complex resource dependencies, input validation, and schema-driven configuration.

* **Environment Operations**  
  Comprehensive environment management including deployment orchestration, release monitoring, scaling operations, and state management with extensive safety validations.

* **Safety-First Design**  
  All destructive operations require explicit user confirmation with dry-run previews. Comprehensive validation ensures safe execution of infrastructure changes.

* **Schema-Driven Configuration**  
  Automatic schema validation and sample generation for all resource types, ensuring configurations meet requirements before deployment.

## Prerequisites

The MCP Server requires [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management and execution.

The package is available on PyPI: [facets-cp-mcp-server](https://pypi.org/project/facets-cp-mcp-server/)

#### Install `uv` with Homebrew:
```bash
brew install uv
```

For other methods, see the [official uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Integration with Claude

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "facets-control-plane": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "facets-cp-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1",
        "CONTROL_PLANE_URL": "<YOUR_CONTROL_PLANE_URL>",
        "FACETS_USERNAME": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
        "FACETS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>",
        "FACETS_PROFILE": "default"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For a locally cloned repository, use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "facets-control-plane": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/control-plane-mcp-server",
        "--module",
        "control_plane_mcp.server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1",
        "CONTROL_PLANE_URL": "<YOUR_CONTROL_PLANE_URL>",
        "FACETS_USERNAME": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
        "FACETS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>",
        "FACETS_PROFILE": "default"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

⚠ Replace `<YOUR_USERNAME>`, `<YOUR_TOKEN>`, and `<YOUR_CONTROL_PLANE_URL>` with your actual authentication data.

The `uv` runner automatically manages environment and dependency setup using the `pyproject.toml` file.

If you have already logged into FTF CLI, specifying `FACETS_PROFILE` is sufficient.

For token generation and authentication setup, please refer to the official Facets documentation:

Note: Similar setup is available in Cursor read [here](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)

## Usage Highlights

### Resource Management Workflow

Complete workflow for creating, updating, and configuring resources:

1. **Discovery**: Use `list_available_resources()` to explore available resource types and flavors
2. **Dependencies**: Call `get_module_inputs()` to understand required inputs and compatible resources  
3. **Understanding**: Use `get_spec_for_module()` and `get_sample_for_module()` for schema and structure
4. **Creation**: Create resources with `add_resource()` including dependency resolution and validation
5. **Configuration**: Update settings with `update_resource()` and validate with `get_spec_for_resource()`
6. **Cross-referencing**: Link resources using `get_output_references()` and `get_resource_output_tree()`

### Environment Management Workflow

Complete environment lifecycle management:

1. **Discovery**: Use `get_all_environments()` to see available environments in your project
2. **Selection**: Set active environment with `use_environment()` for all operations
3. **Monitoring**: Track environment status with `get_current_environment_details()` and release monitoring tools
4. **Deployment**: Create and execute release plans for targeted or full updates
5. **Operations**: Scale environments, manage state, and perform recovery operations as needed
6. **Override Management**: Apply environment-specific configurations while preserving base project settings

### Safety Features

- **Dry-run Previews**: All destructive operations show change previews before execution
- **User Confirmation**: Explicit confirmation required for irreversible actions
- **Schema Validation**: All configurations validated against resource schemas before deployment
- **Dependency Checking**: Automatic validation of resource dependencies and compatibility
- **State Management**: Safe handling of terraform state with unlock capabilities for recovery

---

## Example Usage

Once configured with Claude Desktop, you can:

1. **Project Operations**: "Show me all available projects" → "Use project 'my-web-app'" → "List all resources in this project"
2. **Resource Creation**: "Help me add a new PostgreSQL database" → "Connect my service to the database" → "Update the service configuration"  
3. **Environment Management**: "List all environments" → "Use the staging environment" → "Create a release plan for the API service"
4. **Monitoring**: "Show me active releases" → "Get logs for the latest deployment" → "Check if the environment is running"
5. **Override Management**: "Set the replica count to 3 in staging" → "Preview the effect of this change" → "Apply the override"

All operations include comprehensive validation, safety checks, and clear feedback on success or failure conditions.

---

## Development Setup

For development and testing:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Facets-cloud/control-plane-mcp-server.git
cd control-plane-mcp-server

# Set up environment and install dependencies
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv sync

# Run the server for development
uv run --module control_plane_mcp.server
```

### Extending the Server

To add support for more Control Plane APIs:

1. Add new tool methods using the `@mcp.tool()` decorator in the `control_plane_mcp/tools/` directory
2. Import your tools in the appropriate `__init__.py` to register them with the MCP instance
3. Follow existing implementation patterns for error handling, validation, and user confirmation
