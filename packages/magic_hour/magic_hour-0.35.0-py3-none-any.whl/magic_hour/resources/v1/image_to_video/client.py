        Image-to-Video

        Create a Image To Video video. The estimated frame cost is calculated using 30 FPS. This amount is deducted from your account balance when a video is queued. Once the video is complete, the cost will be updated based on the actual number of frames rendered.

            height: `height` is deprecated and no longer influences the output video's resolution.

        Output resolution is determined by the **minimum** of:
        - The resolution of the input video
        - The maximum resolution allowed by your subscription tier. See our [pricing page](https://magichour.ai/pricing) for more details.
