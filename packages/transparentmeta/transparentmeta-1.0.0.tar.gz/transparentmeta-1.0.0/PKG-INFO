# TransparentMeta

[TransparentMeta](https://github.com/Transparent-Audio/transparentmeta) is the standard for compliance with AI audio transparency
legislation with metadata.

It's an open-source Python library developed by 
[Transparent Audio](https://www.transparentaudio.ai/). It allows users to add and verify cryptographically signed metadata in 
audio files. 

TransparentMeta helps generative AI companies comply with AI transparency laws, 
such as the *EU AI Act* and the *California AI Transparency Act*. By using cryptographic signing, robust file 
validation, and a modular SDK, users can label AI-generated audio 
content with transparent metadata simply and effectively.

- 🐛 If you discover bugs, please report them in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Transparent-Audio/transparentmeta/issues)

## 🚀 Features

- Add cryptographically signed transparency metadata to MP3 and WAV files  
- Read and verify metadata to detect AI-generated audio  
- Key pair generation and signature verification built-in  
- Simple Python SDK for easy integration in your application
- 100% test coverage via unit and integration tests  

## 🔧 Use Cases

- Speech synthesis and voice cloning labeling output with transparency metadata  
- Generative AI music and sound effects tagging output with metadata and attribution  
- Help with compliance with *EU AI Act* & *California AI Transparency Act*  
- Building trusted pipelines with verifiable audio provenance  

## 📦 Installation

### From PyPi
Installing TransparentMeta from PyPI using pip is the recommended way:

```bash
pip install transparentmeta
```

### From Source
You can also install TransparentMeta directly from the repository. This 
project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
You’ll need to install Poetry first.

To install TransparentMeta from source code run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Transparent-Audio/transparentmeta.git
cd transparentmeta
```

Then, activate your Poetry environment:
```bash
poetry env use python3.12  # or any Python >=3.12 you have installed
poetry env activate
```

The last command will print something like:
```
source /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate
```
Copy and paste that command into your shell to activate the Poetry virtual environment.

This is the workflow for Poetry ≥2.0. If you are using Poetry ≤1.x, run 
`poetry shell` instead — it will activate the
environment in a new subshell automatically.


Now, you can install the project with:
```bash
make install
```

To install in development mode, run:
```bash
make install_dev
```

`make install` and `make install_dev` wrap relevant Poetry commands. They can 
be found along with other useful commands in the [Makefile](Makefile).

## 🧩 Dependencies 
TransparentMeta relies on the following core libraries:
- [mutagen](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) – for reading and writing audio metadata (MP3, WAV, etc.)
- [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) – for generating and verifying digital signatures 
- [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) – for data validation and 
  data structures

You can find all dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
