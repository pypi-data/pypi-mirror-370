# PyPho

This repository provides a Python package dedicated to photogrammetric design called **PyPho**.  
Notebooks for testing and using pypho online are provided in a twin repository: [PyPho_notebooks](https://github.com/GeoISTO/PyPho_notebooks)

## Development ##

Current version: 0.0.2  
Main repository for PyPho is at: [GitHub/PyPho](https://github.com/GeoISTO/PyPho)

### Dependencies ###

**PyPho** primarilly depends on the incredible [pyvista](https://pyvista.org/) package for the interactive scenes and 3D visualisation.  
**Pyvista** in turns relies on [trame](https://kitware.github.io/trame/guide/) and interfaces [vtk](https://vtk.org) for this.  
Note that **trame** comes with a main package, but requires companion packages to be installed as well to support the various backends.

Some computational aspects such as rotations are imported from [scipy](https://scipy.org)  
and dataframes manipulations rely on [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).  
Note that [numpy](https://numpy.org/) is also used, but should be already installed as a dependence of pandas.

### Environment ###

Please refer to the [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) file for a complete list of requirements and versions.  
Check the ```project.dependencies``` variable.

It is recommended to create an environment to separate contexts when using python packages.

Environment for PyPho is described in the requirements.txt file and can be used as follows:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
