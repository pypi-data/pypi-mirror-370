About

Momovu is a PDF margin visualization tool specifically designed for the publishing industry.
It helps publishers, book designers, and print professionals ensure their PDFs have proper margins, spine widths,
and layout specifications before sending them to print.

Purpose
=======

Publishing books requires precise attention to margins, bleeds, and safety zones. A small error in margin
calculations can result in text being cut off, images bleeding incorrectly, or spine text being misaligned.
Momovu addresses these challenges by providing:

* **Real-time visualization** of safety margins and trim lines
* **Spine width calculations** based on page count
* **Dustjacket layout preview** with flap dimensions
* **Interactive tools** for examining every detail of your PDF
