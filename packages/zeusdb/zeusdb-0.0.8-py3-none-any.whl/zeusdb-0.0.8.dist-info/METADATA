           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## ✨ What is ZeusDB?

ZeusDB is a next-generation, high-performance data platform designed for modern analytics, machine learning, and real-time insights. Born out of the need for scalable, intelligent data infrastructure, ZeusDB fuses the power of traditional databases with the flexibility and performance of modern data architectures. It is built for data teams, engineers, and analysts who need low-latency access to complex analytical workflows, without sacrificing ease of use or developer control.

ZeusDB serves as the backbone for demanding applications, offering advanced features such as:

  - Vector and structured data support to power hybrid search, recommendation engines, and LLM integrations.

  - Real-time analytics with low-latency querying, ideal for dashboards and ML model serving.

  - Extensibility and safety through modern languages like Rust and Python, enabling custom logic and high-performance pipelines.

  - DevOps-ready deployment across cloud or on-prem, with version-controlled configuration, observability hooks, and minimal operational overhead.

Whether you are building a GenAI backend, managing large-scale time-series data, or architecting a unified analytics layer, ZeusDB gives you the foundation to move fast, at scale, with the flexibility of modular architecture.

<br/>

## 🛠️ Installation

You can install ZeusDB with 'uv' or alternatively using 'pip'.

### Recommended (with uv):
```bash
uv pip install zeusdb
```

### Alternatively (using pip):
```bash
pip install zeusdb
```

<br/>

## 📦 ZeusDB Vector Database

ZeusDB Vector Database is a high-performance, Rust-powered vector database built for fast and scalable similarity search across high-dimensional embeddings. Designed for modern machine learning and AI workloads, it provides efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, supports real-time querying at scale, and seamlessly transitions from in-memory performance to durable disk persistence.

Whether you're powering document search, enabling natural language interfaces, or building custom vector-based tools, ZeusDB offers a lightweight, extensible foundation for high-performance vector retrieval. It’s also well-suited for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where fast and semantically rich context retrieval is critical to enhancing large language model (LLM) responses.

index = vdb.create(index_type="hnsw", dim=8)

# Vector embeddings with accompanying ID's and Metadata
records = [
    {"id": "doc_001", "values": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.6, 0.7], "metadata": {"author": "Alice"}},
    {"id": "doc_002", "values": [0.9, 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.8, 0.5, 0.3, 0.9], "metadata": {"author": "Bob"}},
    {"id": "doc_003", "values": [0.11, 0.21, 0.31, 0.15, 0.41, 0.22, 0.61, 0.72], "metadata": {"author": "Alice"}},
    {"id": "doc_004", "values": [0.85, 0.15, 0.42, 0.27, 0.83, 0.52, 0.33, 0.95], "metadata": {"author": "Bob"}},
    {"id": "doc_005", "values": [0.12, 0.22, 0.33, 0.13, 0.45, 0.23, 0.65, 0.71], "metadata": {"author": "Alice"}},
]

# Upload records using the `add()` method
add_result = index.add(records)
print("\n--- Add Results Summary ---")
print(add_result.summary())

# Perform a similarity search and print the top 2 results
# Query Vector
query_vector = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.6, 0.7]

# Query with no filter (all documents)
results = index.search(vector=query_vector, filter=None, top_k=2)
print("\n--- Query Results Output - Raw ---")
print(results)

print("\n--- Query Results Output - Formatted ---")
for i, res in enumerate(results, 1):
    print(f"{i}. ID: {res['id']}, Score: {res['score']:.4f}, Metadata: {res['metadata']}")
```

*Output*
