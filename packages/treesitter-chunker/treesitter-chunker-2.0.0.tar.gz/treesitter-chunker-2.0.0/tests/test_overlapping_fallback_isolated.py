This is the introduction paragraph with some context about the document.
It spans multiple lines to provide enough content for chunking.

## Section 1: Overview

Here we have the first section with detailed information.
This section contains multiple paragraphs to test overlap detection.

The chunker should ideally find natural boundaries at paragraph breaks.
This helps maintain context when processing chunks.

## Section 2: Details

More content in the second section.
We want to ensure overlapping works correctly.

### Subsection 2.1

Even more detailed content here.
Testing nested structure handling.

## Conclusion

Final thoughts and summary."""
