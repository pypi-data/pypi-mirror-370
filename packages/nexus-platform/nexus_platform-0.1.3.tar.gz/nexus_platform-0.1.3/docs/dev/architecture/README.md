# Architecture

Understanding the core design principles and components that make Nexus a powerful plugin-based application platform.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Nexus is built on a plugin-first architecture where modularity, extensibility, and performance are the primary design goals.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Plugin-First Design
Every feature in Nexus is implemented as a plugin, ensuring:
- **Modularity**: Independent, testable components
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new functionality
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Reusability**: Plugins can be shared across projects

### Event-Driven Architecture
Loose coupling through asynchronous events:
- **Publishers**: Emit events when actions occur
- **Subscribers**: React to events of interest
- **Event Bus**: Routes events between components
- **Priority System**: Control event processing order

### Service Registry Pattern
Dependency injection and service discovery:
- **Registration**: Services register themselves
- **Discovery**: Components find needed services
- **Lifecycle**: Automatic service management
- **Testing**: Easy mocking and isolation

## 🔍 Architecture Patterns

### Layered Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[HTTP Layer] --> B[Application Layer]
    B --> C[Business Logic Layer]
    C --> D[Data Access Layer]
    D --> E[Infrastructure Layer]
    
    subgraph "Cross-Cutting Concerns"
        F[Security]
        G[Logging]
        H[Monitoring]
        I[Configuration]
    end
    
    F -.-> A
    F -.-> B
    F -.-> C
    
    G -.-> A
    G -.-> B
    G -.-> C
    
    H -.-> A
    H -.-> B
    H -.-> C
    
    I -.-> A
    I -.-> B
    I -.-> C
```

### Plugin Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Discovered: Plugin Found
    Discovered --> Loading: Load Manifest
    Loading --> Loaded: Code Imported
    Loaded --> Initializing: Call initialize()
    Initializing --> Active: Success
    Initializing --> Failed: Error
    Active --> Stopping: Shutdown Signal
    Stopping --> Stopped: Cleanup Complete
    Stopped --> [*]
    Failed --> [*]
    
    Active --> Active: Handle Events
    Active --> Active: Process Requests
```

## 🎨 Design Principles

### 1. Convention over Configuration
- Sensible defaults for common use cases
- Minimal required configuration
- Clear conventions for plugin structure
- Automatic discovery and registration

### 2. Fail Fast, Fail Safe
- Early validation of configuration
- Graceful degradation when plugins fail
- Isolation of plugin failures
- Comprehensive error reporting

### 3. Async-First
- Non-blocking I/O throughout
- Async plugin interfaces
- Event-driven communication
- Scalable request handling

### 4. Developer Experience
- Clear, discoverable APIs
- Comprehensive documentation
- Rich tooling and CLI support
- Excellent error messages

## 🔄 Request Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant F as FastAPI
    participant M as Middleware
    participant PM as Plugin Manager
    participant P as Plugin
    participant E as Event Bus
    participant S as Services
    
    C->>F: HTTP Request
    F->>M: Apply Middleware
    M->>PM: Route to Plugin
    PM->>P: Handle Request
    P->>E: Emit Events
    P->>S: Use Services
    S-->>P: Return Data
    E-->>P: Event Responses
    P-->>PM: Response Data
    PM-->>F: HTTP Response
    F-->>C: Send Response
```

## 🔧 System Architecture

### Deployment Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Load Balancer"
        LB[nginx/HAProxy]
    end
    
    subgraph "Application Tier"
        A1[Nexus Instance 1]
        A2[Nexus Instance 2]
        A3[Nexus Instance N]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Tier"
        DB[(Database)]
        CACHE[(Redis Cache)]
        FILES[File Storage]
    end
    
    subgraph "Monitoring"
        METRICS[Metrics Store]
        LOGS[Log Aggregation]
        ALERTS[Alerting]
    end
    
    LB --> A1
    LB --> A2
    LB --> A3
    
    A1 --> DB
    A2 --> DB
    A3 --> DB
    
    A1 --> CACHE
    A2 --> CACHE
    A3 --> CACHE
    
    A1 --> FILES
    A2 --> FILES
    A3 --> FILES
    
    A1 --> METRICS
    A2 --> METRICS
    A3 --> METRICS
    
    A1 --> LOGS
    A2 --> LOGS
    A3 --> LOGS
```

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Scalability Patterns
- **Horizontal scaling**: Stateless application design
- **Vertical scaling**: Efficient resource utilization
- **Database scaling**: Read replicas and partitioning
- **Caching strategies**: Multi-level caching hierarchy

### Memory Management
- **Plugin isolation**: Separate memory spaces
- **Resource pooling**: Connection and object pools
- **Garbage collection**: Optimized GC settings
- **Memory monitoring**: Real-time usage tracking

### I/O Optimization
- **Async operations**: Non-blocking I/O
- **Connection pooling**: Reuse database connections
- **Batch processing**: Aggregate operations
- **Lazy loading**: Load data on demand
