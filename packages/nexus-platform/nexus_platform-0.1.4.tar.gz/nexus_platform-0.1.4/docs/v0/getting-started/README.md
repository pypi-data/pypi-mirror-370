## 🚀 Quick Overview

### What is Nexus?
Nexus is a plugin-based application platform where every feature is a plugin. This makes applications:
- **Modular**: Independent, reusable components
- **Scalable**: Add features without touching core code
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Testable**: Isolated plugin testing
