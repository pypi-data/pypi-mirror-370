# Overview

Welcome to Nexus Platform! This overview will help you understand what Nexus is, why you might want to use it, and how to get started.

## What is Nexus Platform?

Nexus Platform is a modern, plugin-based application framework built on top of FastAPI. It's designed to help developers create modular, scalable applications with a focus on:

- **Modularity**: Build applications as collections of independent plugins
- **Extensibility**: Easy to extend and customize through plugins
- **Performance**: Built on FastAPI for high-performance async operations
- **Developer Experience**: Rich tooling and intuitive APIs
- **Production Ready**: Enterprise features built-in

## Core Concepts

### Plugins
Plugins are the building blocks of Nexus applications. Each plugin is a self-contained module that can:
- Provide API endpoints
- Handle events
- Register services
- Extend functionality

### Event Bus
The event bus enables loose coupling between components by allowing plugins to communicate through events without direct dependencies.

### Service Registry
A centralized registry for discovering and managing services across your application.

### Configuration
Environment-aware configuration management with support for multiple formats (YAML, JSON, environment variables).
