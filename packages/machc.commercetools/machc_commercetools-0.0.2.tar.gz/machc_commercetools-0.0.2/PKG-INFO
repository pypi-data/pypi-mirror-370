# MachC Commercetools Adapter Library

The **MachC Commercetools Adapter Library** is designed to bridge the modular components within the MachC ecosystem with the powerful features of the **Commercetools platform**. This adapter library simplifies connectivity and ensures that e-commerce solutions developed using MachC can take full advantage of Commercetools' capabilities, such as product management, order workflows, and customer interactions, while adhering to Clean Architecture principles.

This library abstracts the complexities of integrating with Commercetools APIs, enabling developers to focus on business logic without worrying about interoperability issues. By providing reusable components and a clean interface, the adapter ensures smooth communication between MachC domain libraries (e.g., Product, User, Order) and the Commercetools backend.
