# Spec-Driven MCP Server

Your living source-of-truth for product & engineering specs — built for **VS Code + AI agents**.

**Markdown specs → SQLite → dashboard → MCP tools.**

---

## Why use this?

* Centralize **requirements**, **acceptance criteria**, and **non-functional** specs in one place.
* Track verification with **pass/fail events**; roll-ups show what's **VERIFIED / FAILING / PARTIAL / UNTESTED**.
* Give AI agents safe MCP access to **read, search, edit, and record verification**.
* **Auto-launching dashboard** provides instant web UI access from VS Code.
* Lightweight **HTML dashboard** (Tailwind + htmx/Alpine) for quick browsing and edits.

---

## Quick start

### 1) Install the tool

We recommend **pipx** so the CLI is on your PATH without virtualenv chores:

```bash
pipx install spec-driven-mcp
```

Or with pip:
```bash
pip install spec-driven-mcp
```

### 2) Add this to `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    "specs-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "spec-mcp-stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

Open Copilot Chat → Agent mode, start the server from **MCP Servers** and use the tools/resources.

**🚀 Dashboard Auto-Start:** The MCP server automatically starts the web dashboard in the background at **http://localhost:8765** when launched from VS Code. No separate dashboard command needed!

---

## Defaults that "just work"

* **Database location:** Always uses **project-local** `<workspace-root>/.spec-mcp/specs.db` when running in a VS Code workspace
* **Zero configuration:** Works in any directory without setup files or environment variables
* **Automatic schema:** Database and tables are created automatically on first use


You can manage the server from VS Code's MCP view (start/stop/restart).

**Running outside a VS Code workspace?**
The server falls back to platform-native user data directories:
- **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SpecMCP\spec-mcp\specs.db`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/SpecMCP/spec-mcp/specs.db`  
- **Linux:** `~/.local/state/spec-mcp/specs.db` (follows XDG spec)

## What you can do (MCP tools & resources)

### Tools

* `create_feature(feature_key, name)` — create a new feature
* `create_spec(spec_id, feature_key, kind, description, parent_id?)` — create requirements/ACs/NFRs
* `record_verification(spec_id, outcome, source?, notes?)` — append pass/fail and update roll-ups
* `update_spec(spec_id, fields…)` — edit description and metadata
* `search_specs(status?, kind?, feature?)` — filter list
* `dashboard_status()` — check if the web dashboard is running

### Resources

* `dashboard://status` — dashboard status and URL information

---

## CLI Commands

All commands work from any directory:

```bash
# Check database location
spec-mcp db-path

# Create features and specs
spec-mcp create-feature user-auth "User Authentication System"
spec-mcp create-spec REQ-AUTH-001 user-auth REQUIREMENT --description "System shall provide secure authentication"
spec-mcp create-spec AC-AUTH-001 user-auth AC --description "User can log in with email/password" --parent-id REQ-AUTH-001

# Record verification events
spec-mcp record-event AC-AUTH-001 PASSED --source "pytest::test_login" --notes "Login test passed"

# View all data
spec-mcp dump

# Start web dashboard
spec-mcp dashboard

# Start MCP server (for development/testing)
spec-mcp dev

# Reset database (destructive)
spec-mcp reset-db
```

For detailed help on any command: `spec-mcp <command> --help`

## Accessing the Dashboard

**Automatic Start (VS Code):** When you start the MCP server from VS Code, the dashboard automatically launches at **http://localhost:8765**.

**Manual Start (CLI):** You can also start the dashboard manually:

```bash
spec-mcp dashboard --port 8765
```

The dashboard provides:
- Browse features, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- View verification status and trends  
- Edit specs inline with modern web forms
- See roll-up status from leaf ACs to requirements to features
- Clickable navigation between related specs
- Responsive design with intuitive status indicators
- Real-time updates when specs are modified

---

## Status (how we compute it)

* **VERIFIED** — all leaves passed
* **FAILING** — at least one failing leaf
* **PARTIAL** — some passed, some untested
* **UNTESTED** — no verification yet

Leaves = ACs and NFRs; requirements roll up from their children.

---

## Integrating tests

From your test runner (or CI), call the MCP tool after a check:

```python
# Pseudocode with your MCP client
call_tool("record_verification", {
  "spec_id": "AC-LOGIN-001",
  "outcome": "PASSED", 
  "source": "pytest::test_login"
})
```

---

## Architecture & Status

**Current Status: ✅ Production Ready**

- **Unified Package:** All functionality consolidated in `spec_mcp/` 
- **Dual Entry Points:** 
  - `spec-mcp` - Full-featured CLI with all commands
  - `spec-mcp-stdio` - MCP server for VS Code integration (auto-starts dashboard)
- **Simplified Schema:** Specs now use a single `description` field (migrated from title/statement)
- **Integrated Dashboard:** Web UI automatically starts with MCP server and runs in background
- **Centralized Database Logic:** All DB operations in `spec_mcp/db.py`
- **Modern Web Dashboard:** Built with Starlette, Tailwind CSS, htmx, and Alpine.js
- **Type Safety:** Full type hints throughout codebase
- **Tested:** Comprehensive smoke tests verify core functionality

**Key Components:**
- `db.py` - SQLite database layer and MCP helpers
- `mcp_server.py` - FastMCP server with tools and resources  
- `mcp_main.py` - MCP server entry point with dashboard auto-start
- `cli.py` - Typer-based command line interface
- `dashboard.py` - Web UI for browsing and editing specs
- `verification.py` - Shared verification event recording logic

## Development

```bash
# Clone and install in development mode
git clone <repo-url>
cd spec-driven-mcp
pip install -e .

# Run tests
python tests/test_basic.py

# Start MCP server for testing (auto-starts dashboard at localhost:8765)
spec-mcp-stdio

# Start dashboard manually (if needed)
spec-mcp dashboard
```
