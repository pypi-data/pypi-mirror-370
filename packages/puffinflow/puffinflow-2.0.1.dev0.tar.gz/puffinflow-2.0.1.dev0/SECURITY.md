## üîí Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Secure Configuration

```python
# Good: Use environment variables for sensitive config
import os
from puffinflow.core.config import get_settings

settings = get_settings()
# Credentials loaded from environment or secure secret store

# Bad: Hardcoded credentials
# api_key = "secret-key-123"  # Don't do this!
```

#### Resource Isolation

```python
# Good: Use resource limits
from puffinflow.core.resources import ResourceRequirements

requirements = ResourceRequirements(
    cpu=2.0,  # Limit CPU usage
    memory=1024,  # Limit memory usage
    timeout=300  # Set execution timeout
)

agent = Agent("secure-agent", resource_requirements=requirements)
```

#### Input Validation

```python
# Good: Validate inputs
def process_user_input(user_data: str) -> str:
    if not user_data or len(user_data) > 1000:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input length")

    # Sanitize input
    sanitized = user_data.strip()
    return sanitized

# Good: Use type hints and validation
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class WorkflowConfig(BaseModel):
    name: str
    max_agents: int

    @validator('name')
    def validate_name(cls, v):
        if not v.isalnum():
            raise ValueError('Name must be alphanumeric')
        return v
```

#### Secure State Management

```python
# Good: Avoid storing sensitive data in state
@agent.state
async def process_payment(context):
    # Don't store credit card numbers in context
    payment_token = context.get("payment_token")  # Use tokens instead
    result = await process_payment_securely(payment_token)
    return {"transaction_id": result.id}  # Return safe identifiers
```

### For Developers

#### Code Security Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
2. **Output Encoding**: Properly encode outputs to prevent injection
3. **Error Handling**: Don't leak sensitive information in error messages
4. **Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive data
5. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities

#### Security Testing

```python
# Example security test
def test_agent_input_validation():
    """Test that agent properly validates inputs."""
    agent = Agent("test-agent")

    # Test SQL injection attempt
    malicious_input = "'; DROP TABLE users; --"
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        agent.process_input(malicious_input)

    # Test XSS attempt
    xss_input = "<script>alert('xss')</script>"
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        agent.process_input(xss_input)

    # Test oversized input
    huge_input = "a" * 1000000
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        agent.process_input(huge_input)
```

## üîç Security Scanning

### Automated Security Tools

We use multiple security scanning tools:

- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis security testing
- **TruffleHog**: Secret detection
- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis

### Running Security Scans

```bash
# Install security tools
pip install bandit safety semgrep

# Run Bandit scan
bandit -r src/ -f json

# Check for vulnerable dependencies
safety check

# Run Semgrep security rules
semgrep --config=auto src/
```
