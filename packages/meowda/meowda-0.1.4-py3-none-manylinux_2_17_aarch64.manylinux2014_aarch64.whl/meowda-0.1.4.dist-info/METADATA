Meowda, manage multiple Python virtual environments with ease. It's based on [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and provides a conda-like CLI (_NOT_ a replacement) for Python virtual environments management.

## Installation

Before installing Meowda, make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed.

### With uv

```bash
uv tool install meowda
```

### With cargo

```bash
cargo install meowda
```

## Usage

Meowda provides a conda-like activate/deactivate interface for managing virtual environments. Before using Meowda, you need to initialize it in your shell. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
meowda init <shell_profile>
# For example, for bash:
meowda init ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
# For zsh:
meowda init ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

After initialization, you can use Meowda to create and manage virtual environments. Here are some basic commands:

```bash
meowda create meow-env -p 3.14
meowda activate meow-env
meowda install ruff
meowda env list
meowda deactivate
```

## VS Code Integration

To integrate Meowda with VS Code, you need to add the following configuration to your `settings.json` file:

```json
{
   "python.venvFolders": [".meowda/venvs", "~/.local/share/meowda/venvs"]
}
```
