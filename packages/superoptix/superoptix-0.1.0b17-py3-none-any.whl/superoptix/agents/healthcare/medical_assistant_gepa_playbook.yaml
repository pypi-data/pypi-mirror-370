      - name: medication_interaction_query
        description: Should provide comprehensive medication interaction analysis
        input:
          medical_query: "What are the interactions between warfarin and ibuprofen?"
          patient_context: "Adult patient on anticoagulation therapy"
        expected_output:
          clinical_analysis: "Warfarin and ibuprofen have a significant drug interaction. Ibuprofen can increase bleeding risk by affecting platelet function and potentially displacing warfarin from protein binding sites."
          risk_factors: "Increased bleeding risk, potential for dangerous INR elevation, gastrointestinal bleeding risk"
          recommendations: "Consult prescribing physician before combining these medications. Alternative pain management may be recommended."
          patient_education: "These medications can interact to increase bleeding risk. Your doctor needs to monitor you closely if both are necessary."
          medical_disclaimer: "This information is for educational purposes only. Always consult your healthcare provider before making medication changes."
      - name: symptom_analysis_chest_pain
        description: Should analyze chest pain symptoms systematically
        input:
          medical_query: "35-year-old reports sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breathing, started after coughing fit"
          patient_context: "Otherwise healthy adult, no cardiac risk factors"
        expected_output:
          clinical_analysis: "Sharp chest pain worsening with inspiration (pleuritic pain) following cough suggests possible musculoskeletal strain, costochondritis, or pleuritis."
          risk_factors: "Must rule out serious causes: pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, cardiac causes despite low risk"
          recommendations: "Requires immediate medical evaluation to rule out serious causes. Chest pain should always be evaluated promptly."
          patient_education: "Chest pain can have many causes, from muscle strain to serious conditions. Medical evaluation is essential for proper diagnosis."
          medical_disclaimer: "Chest pain requires immediate medical attention. This analysis does not replace emergency medical care."

          medical_query: "What preventive screenings are recommended for a 45-year-old woman?"
          patient_context: "Average risk, no family history of major diseases"
        expected_output:
          clinical_analysis: "Age 45 preventive care typically includes: mammography screening, cervical cancer screening, cardiovascular risk assessment, diabetes screening, and age-appropriate immunizations."
          risk_factors: "Individual risk factors may modify screening recommendations (family history, personal risk factors)"
          recommendations: "Discuss personalized screening schedule with primary care provider based on individual risk factors and preferences."
          patient_education: "Preventive screenings help detect diseases early when treatment is most effective. Your doctor will create a personalized plan."
          medical_disclaimer: "Screening recommendations vary by individual risk factors. Consult your healthcare provider for personalized guidance."
