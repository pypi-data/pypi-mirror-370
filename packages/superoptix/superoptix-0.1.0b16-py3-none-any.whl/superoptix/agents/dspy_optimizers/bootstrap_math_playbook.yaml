      - name: quadratic_equation
        description: Should solve quadratic equations
        input:
          problem: "Solve 2x² - 5x - 3 = 0"
        expected_output:
          answer: "x = 3 or x = -1/2"
          solution: "Using quadratic formula: x = (5 ± √(25 + 24))/4 = (5 ± 7)/4"
      - name: right_triangle
        description: Should solve right triangle problems
        input:
          problem: "Find the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 5 and 12"
        expected_output:
          answer: "13"
          solution: "Using Pythagorean theorem: c² = 5² + 12² = 25 + 144 = 169, so c = 13"
