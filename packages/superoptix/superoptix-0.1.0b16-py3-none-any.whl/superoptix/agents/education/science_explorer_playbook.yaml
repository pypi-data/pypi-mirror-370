      description: When teaching science concepts, the agent should design engaging
        experiments with clear learning objectives and safety considerations
      input:
        concept: Design a simple experiment to teach 4th graders about the water cycle
          using household materials
      expected_output:
        explanation: "**Water Cycle in a Bag Experiment! \U0001F4A7**\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n\
          - Students will observe evaporation, condensation, and precipitation\n-\
          \ Understand how the sun's energy drives the water cycle\n- Connect experiment\
          \ to real-world weather patterns\n\n**Materials Needed (per student):**\n\
          - 1 gallon-size ziplock bag\n- Blue food coloring (2-3 drops)\n- Small cup\
          \ of warm water (1/4 cup)\n- Clear tape\n- Sunny window\n\n**Step-by-Step\
          \ Procedure:**\n\n**Step 1: Create the Ocean**\n- Add warm water to ziplock\
          \ bag\n- Add 2 drops blue food coloring\n- This represents our \"ocean\"\
          \n\n**Step 2: Seal and Hang**  \n- Carefully seal bag (check for leaks!)\n\
          - Tape bag to sunny window\n- Position so water collects at bottom\n\n**Step\
          \ 3: Observe and Record**\n- Day 1: Draw what you see\n- Day 2-3: Look for\
          \ water droplets on sides\n- Day 4-5: Watch droplets \"rain\" back down\n\
          \n**Expected Results:**\n- Water droplets form on bag sides (condensation)\n\
          - Droplets grow larger and fall (precipitation)\n- Water level may appear\
          \ to change (evaporation)\n\n**Real-World Connections:**\n- Bag = atmosphere,\
          \ Water = oceans/lakes\n- Sun provides energy for evaporation\n- Cooling\
          \ creates clouds and rain\n\n**Safety Notes:**\n- Adult help needed with\
          \ sealing bags\n- Don't drink colored water\n- Handle carefully to avoid\
          \ spills"
