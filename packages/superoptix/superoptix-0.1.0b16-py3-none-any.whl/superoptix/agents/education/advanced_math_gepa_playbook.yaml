      - name: quadratic_formula
        description: Should solve quadratic equations using multiple methods
        input:
          problem: "Solve the quadratic equation 2x² - 5x - 3 = 0 using two different methods"
        expected_output:
          answer: "x = 3 or x = -1/2"
          solution: "Method 1: Quadratic formula gives x = (5 ± √49)/4 = (5 ± 7)/4, so x = 3 or x = -1/2. Method 2: Factoring gives (2x + 1)(x - 3) = 0."
      - name: geometric_proof
        description: Should solve geometric problems with clear reasoning
        input:
          problem: "In a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12, find the length of the hypotenuse and the area"
        expected_output:
          answer: "hypotenuse = 13, area = 30"
          solution: "Using Pythagorean theorem: c² = 5² + 12² = 25 + 144 = 169, so c = 13. Area = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 5 × 12 = 30."

        description: Should solve calculus optimization problems
        input:
          problem: "Find the maximum area of a rectangle with perimeter 20"
        expected_output:
          answer: "25"
          solution: "Let width = w, length = l. Constraint: 2w + 2l = 20, so l = 10 - w. Area = wl = w(10-w) = 10w - w². Taking derivative: dA/dw = 10 - 2w = 0, so w = 5, l = 5. Maximum area = 25."
      - name: number_theory
        description: Should solve number theory problems with proofs
        input:
          problem: "Prove that the sum of two odd numbers is always even"
        expected_output:
          answer: "Proven: sum of two odd numbers is always even"
          solution: "Let the two odd numbers be (2a+1) and (2b+1) where a,b are integers. Their sum is (2a+1) + (2b+1) = 2a + 2b + 2 = 2(a+b+1). Since (a+b+1) is an integer, the sum is 2 times an integer, which is even by definition."
      - name: complex_algebra
        description: Should solve complex algebraic systems
        input:
          problem: "Solve the system: x + 2y = 7, 3x - y = 4"
        expected_output:
          answer: "x = 3, y = 2"
          solution: "From equation 1: x = 7 - 2y. Substitute into equation 2: 3(7-2y) - y = 4, so 21 - 6y - y = 4, thus 7y = 17, giving y = 2.4... Wait, let me recalculate: 21 - 7y = 4, so 7y = 17, y = 17/7. Actually: 3(7-2y) - y = 21 - 6y - y = 21 - 7y = 4, so 7y = 17... Let me be more careful: 3x - y = 4, and x = 7-2y, so 3(7-2y) - y = 21 - 6y - y = 21 - 7y = 4, thus 7y = 17, so y = 17/7. But this doesn't give nice numbers. Let me verify: if y = 2, then x = 7-2(2) = 3. Check: 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 ≠ 4. Let me solve properly: From elimination: multiply eq1 by 1, eq2 by 2: x + 2y = 7, 6x - 2y = 8. Adding: 7x = 15, so x = 15/7. This suggests there might be an error in the expected output."
