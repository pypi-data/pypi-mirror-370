High-accuracy finite difference methods for GVF analysis.

This module provides finite difference methods optimized for gradually varied flow:
- Central difference (2nd, 4th, 6th order accuracy)
- Upwind/downwind schemes (flow direction sensitivity)
- Adaptive grid methods (variable spacing)
- Boundary condition handling (specialized for GVF)

Designed specifically for solving the GVF equation:
dy/dx = (S₀ - Sf) / (1 - Fr²)

Where accuracy and stability are critical near critical depth (Fr ≈ 1).
