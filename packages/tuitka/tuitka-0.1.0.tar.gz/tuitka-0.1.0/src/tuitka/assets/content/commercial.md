# 🏢 Nuitka Commercial

**Advanced protection features essential for enterprise deployment while funding ongoing development of the free Nuitka project.**

## 🛡️ Protection vs. Reverse Engineering

Hiding your source code and contained keys is crucial to your IP protection. For this, you need the **Nuitka Commercial** package.

### 🔐 Protect Constants Data
**Obfuscate contained program constants data**

Your encryption keys, program texts, and library usages all expose textual information that can be valuable input in reverse engineering. **Nuitka Commercial** protects this data completely.

### 📁 Protect Data Files
**Embed and protect your data files**

When your program includes data files, these are normally visible in the file system, exposing your program to risks. **Nuitka Commercial** allows you to embed data files as part of the program constants and protect them from external access.

### 🔧 Protect DLL Files
**Prevent DLL swapping attacks**

**Nuitka VM** allows you to embed DLL files as part of an executable and run inside a protected VM environment.
