This module ensures that data introduced by customers during the extra step of the eCommerce checkout process is seamlessly propagated from the sale order to the corresponding Field Service Management (FSM) order. It transfers key details such as customer references, messages, and attachments, improving communication between sales and service teams while streamlining workflow efficiency.

Usage

2. **Configure Portal User:**
- Navigate to the `Contacts` module.
- Create or edit a contact.
- In the `Action` tab, execute the **Convert to FSM Record** option, select the `Location` record type.
- Grant portal access to this contact.
- Save the contact.

3. **Configure FSM Location**
- Navigate to the `Field Service` module.
- Under `Master Data` > `Locations`, edit the created location.
- Assign a route to the location. Ensure the route has a person assigned to it and days of the week are specified. Adjust the route's maximum capacity as desired.
- Save the location.

4. **Configure FSM Delivery Time Ranges**
- Navigate to the `Field Service` module.
- Under `Master Data` > `Delivery Time Ranges`, create delivery time ranges.
- When the `Route` field is specified, the delivery time range is used on the related route only. When the `Route` field is empty, the delivery time range is used on all routes.
- Save the delivery time ranges.

5. **Configure Field Service Products:**
- Navigate to the `Field Service` module.
- Under `Master Data` > `Products`, create or edit a product.
- In the `Sales` tab, enable the **Create one FSM order per sale order** option.

6. **Create a Sale Order from the E-Commerce:**
- Log in to the e-commerce portal using the portal user created earlier.
- Navigate to the shop and select a field service product.
- Add the product to the cart and proceed to checkout.
- At the `Extra Info` step, add the information.
- Complete the checkout process. To confirm the sale order, if specified in the configuration, the signature and payment must be completed.

7. **Validate the process:**
- Navigate to the `Sales` module.
- Under `Orders`, you will see the new sale order created and confirmed.
- This sale order will be linked to an FSM order, which will contain the extra step information from the sale order.
