"""Provides a thread-safe, file-persisted key-value store.

This module defines the `Memory` class, a concrete implementation of the
`MemoryProtocol`. It uses a dictionary for in-memory storage, protected by a
`threading.Lock` for thread safety. Unlike a purely transient store, this
implementation persists the entire key-value store to a JSON file on every
write operation, allowing state to survive across different CLI invocations.
