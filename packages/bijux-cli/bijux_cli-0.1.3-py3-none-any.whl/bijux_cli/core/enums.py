"""Defines the output format enumeration for the Bijux CLI.

This module provides the `OutputFormat` enum, which represents the
supported structured output formats (JSON and YAML). Using an enum ensures
type safety and provides a single source of truth for format names. It also
includes a mechanism for case-insensitive matching.
