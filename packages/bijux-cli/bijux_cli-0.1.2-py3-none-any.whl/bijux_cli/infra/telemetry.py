"""Provides concrete telemetry service implementations for event tracking.

This module defines concrete classes that implement the `TelemetryProtocol`.
It offers different strategies for handling telemetry events, allowing the
application's analytics behavior to be configured easily.

Key components include:
    * `TelemetryEvent`: An enumeration of all standardized event names, providing
        a single source of truth for telemetry event types.
    * `NullTelemetry`: A no-op implementation that silently discards all events,
        useful for disabling telemetry entirely.
    * `LoggingTelemetry`: An implementation that forwards all telemetry events to
        the application's structured logging service.
