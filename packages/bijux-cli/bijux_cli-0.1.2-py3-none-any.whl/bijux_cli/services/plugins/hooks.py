"""Defines the hook specifications for the Bijux CLI plugin system.

This module uses `pluggy`'s hook specification markers to define the formal
set of hooks that plugins can implement. The `CoreSpec` class groups all
standard lifecycle and execution hooks that the core application will invoke
on registered plugins. This provides a clear and versioned interface for
plugin developers.
