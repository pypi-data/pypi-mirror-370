"""Provides shared utilities for the `bijux memory` command group.

This module centralizes common logic used by the memory-related subcommands.
Its primary responsibility is to provide a consistent way to resolve the
`MemoryProtocol` service from the Dependency Injection (DI) container,
including standardized error handling for cases where the service is
unavailable.
