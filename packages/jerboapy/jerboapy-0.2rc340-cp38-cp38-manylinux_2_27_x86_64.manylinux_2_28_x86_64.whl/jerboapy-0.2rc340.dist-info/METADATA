# Jerboapy

This project is a port of the Jerboa C++ implementation to Python. It is a pybind11 binding to the Jerboa C++ library, which is located in the `jerboa-cpp` directory. The goal of this project is to provide a Python interface for users who prefer to work in Python while leveraging the performance and capabilities of the Jerboa C++ library.

Currently it proves a 3D modeler (understanding that there is an alpha_3 links in their gmaps). 

## Installation


To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install jerboapy
```

### Optional: 3D visualization and advanced features

If you want to use the 3D visualization features and advanced coordinate/color classes, install the extra `ext`:

```bash
pip install jerboapy[ext]
```

This will install additional dependencies for graphical display and advanced geometry. The extra `ext` enables:

- **3D visualization** (with PyVista and Trame)
- The module `jerboa_ext` with:
  - `Point3`: class for 3D coordinates
  - `Color4`: class for RGBA color management

You can then use these classes for embedding coordinates and managing colors in your models.

## Usage

Provide an example of how to use your project:

```python
from jerboapy import *

# Example usage
modeler = Modeler3D()
```
