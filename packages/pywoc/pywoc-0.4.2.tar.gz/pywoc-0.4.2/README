2 fields while considering masking.

Install
-------

Base (runtime only):

    pip install pywoc

Optional extras:

- Plotting support: `pip install pywoc[plot]`
- Examples/tutorial deps (Astropy/Scipy/Matplotlib): `pip install pywoc[examples]`

From source:

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/csabiu/WOC.git

Running
-------

from pywoc import woc

woc(map1, map2, radii, mask=None, centre=None, pixelsize=1,
    plot=False, savefig=None, rbins=20, maxr=None):

- **map1** -- 2‑D ``numpy.ndarray`` representing the reference map. The
  array shape defines the pixel grid and all values should be finite and
  non‑negative.

- **map2** -- second map with the **same shape** as ``map1``. Its units
  should match those of ``map1``. Any ``NaN`` entries are ignored when the
  coefficient is calculated.

- **radii** -- sequence of radius values used to define contours in ``map1``.
  The values are interpreted in units of ``pixelsize`` (pixels if
  ``pixelsize`` is ``1``). For example ``[100, 200, 300]`` means 100, 200 and
  300 pixels or, when ``pixelsize`` gives the physical pixel size, distances in
  those physical units.

- **optional parameters**
    - ``mask`` -- boolean array with the same shape as the maps. ``1`` marks
      valid pixels and ``0`` masks them.
    - ``pixelsize`` -- conversion factor from pixel units to physical units.
    - ``rbins`` -- number of radial bins for the radial profile.
    - ``maxr`` -- maximum radius of the profile in **pixel units**.
    - ``centre`` -- profile centre. ``None`` uses the brightest pixel of
      ``map1``; ``"mid"`` uses the geometric centre; ``[x, y]`` specifies explicit
      coordinates.
    - ``plot`` -- if ``True`` show diagnostic plots.
    - ``savefig`` -- filename for plots when ``plot`` is ``True``.

The call returns a single floating point value containing the weighted
overlap coefficient between ``map1`` and ``map2``.
