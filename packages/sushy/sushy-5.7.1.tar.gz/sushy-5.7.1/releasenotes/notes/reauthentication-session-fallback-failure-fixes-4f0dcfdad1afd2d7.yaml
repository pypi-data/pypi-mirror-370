fixes:
  - |
    Fixes issues with the refresh of ``Session`` based authentication where
    a previous refresh attempt failing could result in a fallback
    to ``Basic`` authentication and would silently fail. The client library
    now attempts to re-authenticate.
  - |
    Fixes silent failures when a refresh of an authentication ``Session``
    fails and was unable to be re-established due to an ``AccessError``.
    Should this occur, now the ``AccessError`` exception is explicitly raised
    as opposed to attempting to fall back to ``Basic`` authentication.
  - |
    Fixes issues where the ``Session`` and ``Basic`` auth interface would
    fallback to ``Basic`` authentication should a ``ConnectionError``
    exception occur while attempting to perform an authentication action.
    ``ConnectionError`` exceptions are signs of networking transport issues,
    and should be investigated. A ``ConnectionError`` exception is now raised.
  - |
    Prevents the combined ``Session`` and ``Basic`` authentication support
    from falling back to ``Basic`` authentication once ``Session`` based
    authentication has been established. This should be considered a potential
    security issue or an environmental change requiring potential client
    re-initialization. This is exposed as an ``AccessError`` exception.
    Continued operations against the Sushy library will attempt to
    reauthenticate, if possible.
