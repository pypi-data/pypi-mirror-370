    Adds an extra check for cases where the BMC provides a SettingsObject
    URI through @Redfish.Settings but this URI does not allow setting boot
    related attributes. Prior to sending a PATCH request to SettingsURI, a
    GET request is issued to verify if it contains the attributes to be
    updated. In case these attributes are missing, the request is made against
    System URI instead.
    Issues such as the one addressed with this change usually manifest
    themselves with a Redfish response containing an error message similar to
    the following: ``MessageId: Base.1.8.PropertyNotWritable, Message: The
    property BootSourceOverrideEnabled is a read only property and cannot be
    assigned a value.``
