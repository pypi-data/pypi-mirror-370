    Fixes potential cases where exceptions from the underlying ``requests``
    library may be raised up through ``sushy``, resulting in client
    applications possibly not understanding that an error has occurred.
    The sushy ``ConnectionError`` exception is now returned upon any exception
    falling under ``RequestException`` from the ``requests`` library.
