    An issue was encountered on some HPE iLO supported machines where the
    Baseboard Management Controller would respond with a HTTP 400 error
    and an error message indicating the requested operation was invalid
    for the then system state. For example, attempting to change the power
    state via the BMC shortly after previously changing the power state.
    We now attempt to retry within the permitted number of retries when
    this error is encountered.
