    Redfish HTTP requests in Sushy now retry automatically on common
    transient connection errors such as connection timeouts or refused
    connections. This helps avoid deployment or teardown failures due
    to temporary BMC unavailability. The number of retries and the
    delay are controlled by the existing options
    `server_side_retries` and `server_side_retries_delay`.
