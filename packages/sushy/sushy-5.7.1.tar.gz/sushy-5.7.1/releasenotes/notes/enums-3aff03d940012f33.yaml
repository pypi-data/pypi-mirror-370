prelude: |
    Sushy now exposes Python enums instead of simple string constants. Please
    check the upgrade notes before updating to this version.
upgrade:
  - |
    Python `enumerations <https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html>`_ are
    now used instead of strings for all Sushy constants. The old names are
    kept but now point to enumerated values, so e.g. ``sushy.POWER_STATE_ON``
    is an alias for ``sushy.PowerState.ON``. Consumers of the library may see
    breakages in two cases:

    * Relying on literal values of the old constants. Use constants instead.
    * Relying on the fact that Sushy constants are strings (e.g. storing them
      in a database). You can either use the ``value`` attribute to get the
      underlying string or create your own mapping.
deprecations:
  - |
    The old constant names (not based on enumerations) are now deprecated.
    For example, use ``sushy.PowerState.ON`` instead of
    ``sushy.POWER_STATE_ON``.
