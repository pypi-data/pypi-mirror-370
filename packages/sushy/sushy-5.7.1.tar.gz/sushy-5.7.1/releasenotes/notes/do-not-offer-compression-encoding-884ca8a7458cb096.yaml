    Fixes unreliable behavior with ETag interactions with some BMCs as
    opportunistic use of compressed responses may cause the BMC to change
    an ETag response to "Weak", which is to be expected as an ETag represents
    an absolute byte-by-byte response consistency, and compression cannot
    reliably honor that contract. Introduction of a client perceiving a
    "Weak" ETag may not be expected by the server, and the server may reject
    responses because the ETag is not a "Strong" ETag when we respond or
    interact with a resource.

    As a result, requests no longer offer oppurtunistic compression
    of responses as an acceptable possibility, which overall has minimal
    impact, espescially when compared to the value of consistent BMC
    behavior and interaction.
