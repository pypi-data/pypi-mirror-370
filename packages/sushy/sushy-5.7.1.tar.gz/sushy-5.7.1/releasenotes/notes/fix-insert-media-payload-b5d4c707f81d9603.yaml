upgrade:
  - |
    "Inserted" and "WriteProtected" optional attributes are no longer present
    in the InsertMedia API call payload when default values {"Inserted": True,
    "WriteProtected": True} are specified by the consumer (e.g. Ironic) and
    PATCH method of configuring virtual media is not used.
    Behaviour is unchanged if PATCH method is used.
fixes:
  - |
    Removing "Inserted" and "WriteProtected" parameters from the Redfish
    VirtualMedia::insert_media() API call payload when default values
    {"Inserted": True, "WriteProtected": True} are set and PATCH method is not
    used. Those parameters are optional as per Redfish schema 2021.1. Some
    BMCs (e.g. SuperMicro X11/X12 platforms) treat these fields as read-only
    and setting them causes vMedia insert failures. These attributes should
    default to True on the BMC side.
    Some BMCs using PATCH method of configuring virtual media (e.g. Lenovo
    SD530) still require "Inserted" attribute, so only changing this for
    non-PATCH methods of configuring virtual media such as InsertMedia action.
