    Alters eTag handling in PATCH requests: First, the original eTag is used.
    In case of a failure, if the eTag provided was weak, it is converted to
    a strong format by removing the weak prefix. If this approach is not
    applicable or fails, the final attempt is made omitting the eTag entirely.
    By taking this approach, no workarounds are applied if BMC is handling
    eTags as expected and in case of failures, known workarounds are
    attempted, improving overall resiliency.
