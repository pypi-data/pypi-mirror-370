    Add retries on iDRAC error with code SYS518 and message "iDRAC is
    currently unable to display any information because data sources are
    unavailable." for all request types in addition to existing GET methods.
    This helps to fix a known intermittent issue when deleting set of volumes
    one after another and iDRAC is reloading after deleting each volume.
