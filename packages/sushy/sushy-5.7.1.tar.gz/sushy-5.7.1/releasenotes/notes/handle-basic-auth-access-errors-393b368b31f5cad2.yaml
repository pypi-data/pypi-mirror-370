    Fixes an issue in the sushy connector object handling where a
    Sushy client utilizing ``basic`` authentication would not raise
    an AccessError exception once the credentials stopped working.
    We now explicitly check to see if ``basic`` authentication
    is in use, and raise the exception if an AccessError is
    encountered.
