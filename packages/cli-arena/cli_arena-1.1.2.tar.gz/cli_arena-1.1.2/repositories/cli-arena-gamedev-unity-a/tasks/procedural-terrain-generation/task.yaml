title: Procedural Terrain Generation with Perlin Noise
description: Implement an infinite procedural terrain generator using Perlin noise. The terrain should feature distinct biome
  zones (e.g., plains, mountains, forests) based on noise values. The solution must be implemented via a CLI command that
  generates a terrain mesh.
