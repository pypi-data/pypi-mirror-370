title: NavMesh Pathfinding AI with Moving Obstacles
description: "Implement an AI agent that uses the NavMesh system to navigate a scene. The agent should be able to adapt its pathfinding to avoid moving obstacles. The solution must be implemented via a CLI command that bakes the NavMesh and then moves the agent to a target position."
