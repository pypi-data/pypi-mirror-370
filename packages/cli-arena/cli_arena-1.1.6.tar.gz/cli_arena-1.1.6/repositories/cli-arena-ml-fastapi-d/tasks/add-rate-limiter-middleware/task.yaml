title: "Add Rate Limiting Middleware"
description: |
  Implement a rate limiter middleware that allows each unique client IP to make at most 5 requests per minute.

  Any client exceeding this limit should receive:
  - Status: 429 Too Many Requests
  - Body: {"detail": "Rate limit exceeded"}

  Requirements:
  - Limit applies per IP address
  - Middleware must not break any existing functionality
  - Use an in-memory dictionary or cache (no external Redis)
  - Rate limit applies to all POST requests under /predict/
