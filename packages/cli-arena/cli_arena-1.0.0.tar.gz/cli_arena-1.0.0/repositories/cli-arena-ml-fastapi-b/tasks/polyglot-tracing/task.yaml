title: "Polyglot Distributed Tracing CLI"
description: |
  Build a CLI tool to simulate distributed tracing across polyglot microservices using SQLAlchemy. The tool should:
  - Model services, languages, traces, spans, and dependencies
  - Allow users to ingest, query, and analyze distributed traces
  - Provide analytics: cross-language latency, error propagation, bottleneck detection, service dependency graphs
  - Support exporting traces to JSON
  - All interaction must be via CLI (no web server)
  - Database schema must be non-trivial and analytics-ready
  - Include robust error handling and input validation
  - Use SQLAlchemy ORM for all data storage and queries

success_criteria:
  - CLI can ingest, query, and analyze distributed traces
  - Analytics commands work on realistic simulated data
  - All tests pass (5-6 tough cases: e.g., cross-language trace, error propagation, bottleneck detection)
