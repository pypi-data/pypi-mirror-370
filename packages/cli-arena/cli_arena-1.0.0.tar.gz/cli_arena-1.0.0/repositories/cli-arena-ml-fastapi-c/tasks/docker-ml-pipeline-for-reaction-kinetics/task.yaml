title: "Docker ML Pipeline for Reaction Kinetics"
description: |
  Build a CLI tool to manage a Docker-based machine learning pipeline for reaction kinetics. The tool should:
  - Ingest reaction kinetics data from CSV/JSON
  - Train a regression model
  - Predict reaction rates from input features
  - Evaluate model performance
  - All interaction via CLI (no web server)
  - Robust error handling
  - Tests for all commands
