title: NavMesh Pathfinding AI with Moving Obstacles
description: Implement an AI agent that uses the NavMesh system to navigate a scene. The agent should be able to adapt its
  pathfinding to avoid moving obstacles. The solution must be implemented via a CLI command that bakes the NavMesh and then
  moves the agent to a target position.
