name: Sanity Test Task
description: 'Create a simple Python test file that verifies basic arithmetic operations.

  The test file should be created at ''tests/unit/test_arithmetic.py'' and should include

  test functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

  '
instructions: "1. Create a new Python test file at 'tests/unit/test_arithmetic.py'\n2. Write test functions for basic arithmetic\
  \ operations:\n   - test_addition: Verify that 1 + 1 equals 2\n   - test_subtraction: Verify that 2 - 1 equals 1\n   - test_multiplication:\
  \ Verify that 2  2 equals 4\n   - test_division: Verify that 4 / 2 equals 2\n3. Run the tests using pytest\n"
files_to_modify:
- tests/unit/test_arithmetic.py
success_criteria:
- All test cases must pass
- The test file must be properly formatted with correct Python syntax
- The test file must be placed in the correct directory structure
