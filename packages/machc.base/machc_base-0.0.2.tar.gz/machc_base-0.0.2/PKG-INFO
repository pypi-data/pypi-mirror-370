# Machc Base Domain Library

The Machc Base Domain Library serves as the foundation for the entire Machc ecosystem by delivering reusable, generic entities and interfaces that act as building blocks for various libraries and business domains. This library provides the essential structures and abstractions required to ensure consistency, modularity, and scalability across systems.

The base entities are designed to encapsulate core principles of domain-driven design while adhering to Clean Architecture principles, ensuring that functionality is logically separated and easy to maintain.
