        Parameters
        ----------
        self
            array instance.
        stream: Optional[Union[int, Any]]
            for CUDA and ROCm, a Python integer representing a pointer to a stream, on devices that support streams. ``stream`` is provided by the consumer to the producer to instruct the producer to ensure that operations can safely be performed on the array (e.g., by inserting a dependency between streams via "wait for event"). The pointer must be an integer larger than or equal to ``-1`` (see below for allowed values on each platform). If ``stream`` is ``-1``, the value may be used by the consumer to signal "producer must not perform any synchronization". The ownership of the stream stays with the consumer. On CPU and other device types without streams, only ``None`` is accepted.

            For other device types which do have a stream, queue, or similar synchronization/ordering mechanism, the most appropriate type to use for ``stream`` is not yet determined. E.g., for SYCL one may want to use an object containing an in-order ``cl::sycl::queue``. This is allowed when libraries agree on such a convention, and may be standardized in a future version of this API standard.

            .. note::
                Support for a ``stream`` value other than ``None`` is optional and implementation-dependent.

            device-specific values of ``stream`` for CUDA:

            - ``None``: producer must assume the legacy default stream (default).
            - ``1``: the legacy default stream.
            - ``2``: the per-thread default stream.
            - ``> 2``: stream number represented as a Python integer.
            - ``0`` is disallowed due to its ambiguity: ``0`` could mean either ``None``, ``1``, or ``2``.

            device-specific values of ``stream`` for ROCm:

            - ``None``: producer must assume the legacy default stream (default).
            - ``0``: the default stream.
            - ``> 2``: stream number represented as a Python integer.
            - Using ``1`` and ``2`` is not supported.

            .. note::
                When ``dl_device`` is provided explicitly, ``stream`` must be a valid
                construct for the specified device type. In particular, when ``kDLCPU``
                is in use, ``stream`` must be ``None`` and a synchronization must be
                performed to ensure data safety.

            .. admonition:: Tip
                :class: important

                It is recommended that implementers explicitly handle streams. If
                they use the legacy default stream, specifying ``1`` (CUDA) or ``0``
                (ROCm) is preferred. ``None`` is a safe default for developers who do
                not want to think about stream handling at all, potentially at the
                cost of more synchronizations than necessary.
        max_version: Optional[tuple[int, int]]
            the maximum DLPack version that the *consumer* (i.e., the caller of
            ``__dlpack__``) supports, in the form of a 2-tuple ``(major, minor)``.
            This method may return a capsule of version ``max_version`` (recommended
            if it does support that), or of a different version.
            This means the consumer must verify the version even when
            `max_version` is passed.
        dl_device: Optional[tuple[enum.Enum, int]]
            the DLPack device type. Default is ``None``, meaning the exported capsule
            should be on the same device as ``self`` is. When specified, the format
            must be a 2-tuple, following that of the return value of :meth:`array.__dlpack_device__`.
            If the device type cannot be handled by the producer, this function must
            raise ``BufferError``.

            The v2023.12 standard only mandates that a compliant library should offer a way for
            ``__dlpack__`` to return a capsule referencing an array whose underlying memory is
            accessible to the Python interpreter (represented by the ``kDLCPU`` enumerator in DLPack).
            If a copy must be made to enable this support but ``copy`` is set to ``False``, the
            function must raise ``BufferError``.

            Other device kinds will be considered for standardization in a future version of this
            API standard.
        copy: Optional[bool]
            boolean indicating whether or not to copy the input. If ``True``, the
            function must always copy (performed by the producer). If ``False``, the
            function must never copy, and raise a ``BufferError`` in case a copy is
            deemed necessary (e.g. if a cross-device data movement is requested, and
            it is not possible without a copy). If ``None``, the function must reuse
            the existing memory buffer if possible and copy otherwise. Default: ``None``.

            When a copy happens, the ``DLPACK_FLAG_BITMASK_IS_COPIED`` flag must be set.

            .. note::
                If a copy happens, and if the consumer-provided ``stream`` and ``dl_device``
                can be understood by the producer, the copy must be performed over ``stream``.

        Returns
        -------
        capsule: PyCapsule
            a DLPack capsule for the array. See :ref:`data-interchange` for details.

        Raises
        ------
        BufferError
            Implementations should raise ``BufferError`` when the data cannot
            be exported as DLPack (e.g., incompatible dtype or strides). Other
            errors are raised when export fails for other reasons (e.g., incorrect
            arguments passed or out of memory).

        Notes
        -----
        The DLPack version scheme is SemVer, where the major DLPack versions
        represent ABI breaks, and minor versions represent ABI-compatible additions
        (e.g., new enum values for new data types or device types).

        The ``max_version`` keyword was introduced in v2023.12, and goes
        together with the ``DLManagedTensorVersioned`` struct added in DLPack
        1.0. This keyword may not be used by consumers until a later time after
        introduction, because producers may implement the support at a different
        point in time.

        It is recommended for the producer to use this logic in the implementation
        of ``__dlpack__``:

        .. code:: python

            if max_version is None:
                # Keep and use the DLPack 0.X implementation
                # Note: from March 2025 onwards (but ideally as late as
                # possible), it's okay to raise BufferError here
            else:
                # We get to produce `DLManagedTensorVersioned` now. Note that
                # our_own_dlpack_version is the max version that the *producer*
                # supports and fills in the `DLManagedTensorVersioned::version`
                # field
                if max_version >= our_own_dlpack_version:
                    # Consumer understands us, just return a Capsule with our max version
                elif max_version[0] == our_own_dlpack_version[0]:
                    # major versions match, we should still be fine here -
                    # return our own max version
                else:
                    # if we're at a higher major version internally, did we
                    # keep an implementation of the older major version around?
                    # For example, if the producer is on DLPack 1.x and the consumer
                    # is 0.y, can the producer still export a capsule containing
                    # DLManagedTensor and not DLManagedTensorVersioned?
                    # If so, use that. Else, the producer should raise a BufferError
                    # here to tell users that the consumer's max_version is too
                    # old to allow the data exchange to happen.

        And this logic for the consumer in :func:`~array_api.from_dlpack`:

        .. code:: python

            try:
                x.__dlpack__(max_version=(1, 0), ...)
                # if it succeeds, store info from the capsule named "dltensor_versioned",
                # and need to set the name to "used_dltensor_versioned" when we're done
            except TypeError:
                x.__dlpack__(...)

        This logic is also applicable to handling of the new ``dl_device`` and ``copy``
        keywords.

        DLPack 1.0 added a flag to indicate that the array is read-only

    Copies an array to a specified data type irrespective of :ref:`type-promotion` rules.

    .. note::
       Casting floating-point ``NaN`` and ``infinity`` values to integral data types is not specified and is implementation-dependent.

    .. note::
       Casting a complex floating-point array to a real-valued data type should not be permitted.

       Historically, when casting a complex floating-point array to a real-valued data type, libraries such as NumPy have discarded imaginary components such that, for a complex floating-point array ``x``, ``astype(x)`` equals ``astype(real(x))``). This behavior is considered problematic as the choice to discard the imaginary component is arbitrary and introduces more than one way to achieve the same outcome (i.e., for a complex floating-point array ``x``, ``astype(x)`` and ``astype(real(x))`` versus only ``astype(imag(x))``). Instead, in order to avoid ambiguity and to promote clarity, this specification requires that array API consumers explicitly express which component should be cast to a specified real-valued data type.

    .. note::
       When casting a boolean input array to a real-valued data type, a value of ``True`` must cast to a real-valued number equal to ``1``, and a value of ``False`` must cast to a real-valued number equal to ``0``.

       When casting a boolean input array to a complex floating-point data type, a value of ``True`` must cast to a complex number equal to ``1 + 0j``, and a value of ``False`` must cast to a complex number equal to ``0 + 0j``.

    .. note::
       When casting a real-valued input array to ``bool``, a value of ``0`` must cast to ``False``, and a non-zero value must cast to ``True``.

       When casting a complex floating-point array to ``bool``, a value of ``0 + 0j`` must cast to ``False``, and all other values must cast to ``True``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        array to cast.
    dtype: dtype
        desired data type.
    copy: bool
        specifies whether to copy an array when the specified ``dtype`` matches the data type of the input array ``x``. If ``True``, a newly allocated array must always be returned.

            -   ``'signed integer'``: signed integer data types (e.g., ``int8``, ``int16``, ``int32``, ``int64``).

           A conforming implementation of the array API standard is **not** limited to only including the dtypes described in this specification in the required data type kinds.

    axis: Optional[int]

    dtype: Optional[dtype]
        data type of the returned array. If ``None``, the returned array must have the same data type as ``x``, unless ``x`` has an integer data type supporting a smaller range of values than the default integer data type (e.g., ``x`` has an ``int16`` or ``uint32`` data type and the default integer data type is ``int64``).

        If the data type (either specified or resolved) differs from the data type of ``x``, the input array should be cast to the specified data type before computing the sum (rationale: the ``dtype`` keyword argument is intended to help prevent overflows). Default: ``None``.

    include_initial: bool

    Returns
    -------
    out: array
        an array containing the cumulative sums. The returned array must have a data type as described by the ``dtype`` parameter above.

    out: array
        if the minimum value was computed over the entire array, a zero-dimensional array containing the minimum value; otherwise, a non-zero-dimensional array containing the minimum values. The returned array must have the same data type as ``x``.

    Notes
    -----
    When the number of elements over which to compute the minimum value is zero, the minimum value is implementation-defined. Specification-compliant libraries may choose to raise an error, return a sentinel value (e.g., if ``x`` is a floating-point input array, return ``NaN``), or return the maximum possible value for the input array ``x`` data type (e.g., if ``x`` is a floating-point array, return ``+infinity``).

    The order of signed zeros is unspecified and thus implementation-defined. When choosing between ``-0`` or ``+0`` as a minimum value, specification-compliant libraries may choose to return either value.

    For backward compatibility, conforming implementations may support complex numbers; however, inequality comparison of complex numbers is unspecified and thus implementation-defined (see :ref:`complex-number-ordering`).

    **Special Cases**

    For floating-point operands,

    -   If ``x_i`` is ``NaN``, the minimum value is ``NaN`` (i.e., ``NaN`` values propagate).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array

    axis: Optional[Union[int, Tuple[int, ...]]]

        exceptions.
    AttributeError
        If the ``__dlpack__`` and ``__dlpack_device__`` methods are not present
        on the input array. This may happen for libraries that are never able

    Returns evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval.

    Let :math:`N` be the number of generated values (which is either ``num`` or ``num+1`` depending on whether ``endpoint`` is ``True`` or ``False``, respectively). For real-valued output arrays, the spacing between values is given by

    .. math::

    Parameters
    ----------
    start: Union[int, float, complex]
        the start of the interval.
    stop: Union[int, float, complex]
        the end of the interval. If ``endpoint`` is ``False``, the function must generate a sequence of ``num+1`` evenly spaced numbers starting with ``start`` and ending with ``stop`` and exclude the ``stop`` from the returned array such that the returned array consists of evenly spaced numbers over the half-open interval ``[start, stop)``.

           The step size changes when `endpoint` is `False`.

    num: int
        number of samples. Must be a nonnegative integer value.
    dtype: Optional[dtype]
        output array data type. Should be a floating-point data type. If ``dtype`` is ``None``,

        -   if either ``start`` or ``stop`` is a ``complex`` number, the output data type must be the default complex floating-point data type.

           If ``dtype`` is not ``None``, conversion of ``start`` and ``stop`` should obey :ref:`type-promotion` rules. Conversions not specified according to :ref:`type-promotion` rules may or may not be permitted by a conforming array library.

    device: Optional[device]

Accordingly, using this function to generate integer output arrays is not portable.

    .. note::

    If ``x`` is real-valued, let :math:`\\mathbb{K}` be the set of real numbers :math:`\\mathbb{R}`, and, if ``x`` is complex-valued, let :math:`\\mathbb{K}` be the set of complex numbers :math:`\\mathbb{C}`.

    The **inverse matrix** :math:`x^{-1} \\in\\ \\mathbb{K}^{n \\times n}` of a square matrix :math:`x \\in\\ \\mathbb{K}^{n \\times n}` is defined as

    .. math::
       x^{-1}x = xx^{-1} = I_n

    where :math:`I_n` is the *n*-dimensional identity matrix.

    The inverse matrix exists if and only if ``x`` is invertible. When ``x`` is invertible, the inverse is unique.

    When ``x`` is a stack of matrices, the function must compute the inverse for each matrix in the stack.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array having shape ``(..., M, M)`` and whose innermost two dimensions form square matrices. Should have a floating-point data type.

    Returns
    -------

    The pseudo-inverse of a matrix :math:`A`, denoted :math:`A^{+}`, is defined as the matrix that "solves" the least-squares problem :math:`Ax = b` (i.e., if :math:`\\overline{x}` is a solution, then :math:`A^{+}` is the matrix such that :math:`\\overline{x} = A^{+}b`).

    While the pseudo-inverse can be defined algebraically, one can understand the pseudo-inverse via singular value decomposition (SVD). Namely, if

    .. math::
       A = U \\Sigma V^H

    is a singular decomposition of :math:`A`, then

    .. math::

    where :math:`U` and :math:`V^H` are orthogonal matrices, :math:`\\Sigma` is a diagonal matrix consisting of :math:`A`'s singular values, and :math:`\\Sigma^{+}` is then a diagonal matrix consisting of the reciprocals of :math:`A`'s singular values, leaving zeros in place. During numerical computation, only elements larger than a small tolerance are considered nonzero, and all others replaced by zeros.

    When ``x`` is a stack of matrices, the function must compute the pseudo-inverse for each matrix in the stack.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array having shape ``(..., M, N)`` and whose innermost two dimensions form ``MxN`` matrices. Should have a floating-point data type.
    rtol: Optional[Union[float, array]]

    Returns the QR decomposition of a full column rank matrix (or a stack of matrices).

    If ``x`` is real-valued, let :math:`\\mathbb{K}` be the set of real numbers :math:`\\mathbb{R}`, and, if ``x`` is complex-valued, let :math:`\\mathbb{K}` be the set of complex numbers :math:`\\mathbb{C}`.

    The **complete QR decomposition** of a matrix :math:`x \\in\\ \\mathbb{K}^{n \\times n}` is defined as

    .. math::
       x = QR

    where :math:`Q \\in\\ \\mathbb{K}^{m \\times m}` is orthogonal when ``x`` is real-valued and unitary when ``x`` is complex-valued and where :math:`R \\in\\ \\mathbb{K}^{m \\times n}` is an upper triangular matrix with real diagonal (even when ``x`` is complex-valued).

    When :math:`m \\gt n` (tall matrix), as :math:`R` is upper triangular, the last :math:`m - n` rows are zero. In this case, the last :math:`m - n` columns of :math:`Q` can be dropped to form the **reduced QR decomposition**.

    .. math::
       x = QR

    where :math:`Q \\in\\ \\mathbb{K}^{m \\times n}` and :math:`R \\in\\ \\mathbb{K}^{n \\times n}`.

    The reduced QR decomposition equals with the complete QR decomposition when :math:`n \\geq m` (wide matrix).

    When ``x`` is a stack of matrices, the function must compute the QR decomposition for each matrix in the stack.

    .. note::
       Whether an array library explicitly checks whether an input array is a full column rank matrix (or a stack of full column rank matrices) is implementation-defined.

    .. warning::
       The elements in the diagonal of :math:`R` are not necessarily positive. Accordingly, the returned QR decomposition is only unique up to the sign of the diagonal of :math:`R`, and different libraries or inputs on different devices may produce different valid decompositions.

    .. warning::
       The QR decomposition is only well-defined if the first ``k = min(m,n)`` columns of every matrix in ``x`` are linearly independent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array having shape ``(..., M, N)`` and whose innermost two dimensions form ``MxN`` matrices of rank ``N``. Should have a floating-point data type.
    mode: Literal['reduced', 'complete']
        decomposition mode. Should be one of the following modes:

        -   ``'reduced'``: compute only the leading ``K`` columns of ``q``, such that ``q`` and ``r`` have dimensions ``(..., M, K)`` and ``(..., K, N)``, respectively, and where ``K = min(M, N)``.
        -   ``'complete'``: compute ``q`` and ``r`` with dimensions ``(..., M, M)`` and ``(..., M, N)``, respectively.

        Default: ``'reduced'``.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Tuple[array, array]
        a namedtuple ``(Q, R)`` whose

class slogdet[TArray: Array](Protocol):
    r"""
    Returns the sign and the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the determinant of a square matrix (or a stack of square matrices) ``x``.

    .. note::
       The purpose of this function is to calculate the determinant more accurately when the determinant is either very small or very large, as calling ``det`` may overflow or underflow.

    The sign of the determinant is given by

    .. math::
       \\operatorname{sign}(\\det x) = \\begin{cases}
       0 & \\textrm{if } \\det x = 0 \\\\
       \\frac{\\det x}{|\\det x|} & \\textrm{otherwise}

    where :math:`|\\det x|` is the absolute value of the determinant of ``x``.

    When ``x`` is a stack of matrices, the function must compute the sign and natural logarithm of the absolute value of the determinant for each matrix in the stack.

    **Special Cases**

    For real-valued floating-point operands,

    - If the determinant is zero, the ``sign`` should be ``0`` and ``logabsdet`` should be ``-infinity``.

    For complex floating-point operands,

    - If the determinant is ``0 + 0j``, the ``sign`` should be ``0 + 0j`` and ``logabsdet`` should be ``-infinity + 0j``.

    .. note::
       Depending on the underlying algorithm, when the determinant is zero, the returned result may differ from ``-infinity`` (or ``-infinity + 0j``). In all cases, the determinant should be equal to ``sign * exp(logabsdet)`` (although, again, the result may be subject to numerical precision errors).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array having shape ``(..., M, M)`` and whose innermost two dimensions form square matrices. Should have a floating-point data type.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Tuple[array, array]
        a namedtuple (``sign``, ``logabsdet``) whose

        -   first element must have the field name ``sign`` and must be an array containing a number representing the sign of the determinant for each square matrix. Must have the same data type as ``x``.
        -   second element must have the field name ``logabsdet`` and must be an array containing the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the determinant for each square matrix. If ``x`` is real-valued, the returned array must have a real-valued floating-point data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion`. If ``x`` is complex, the returned array must have a real-valued floating-point data type having the same precision as ``x`` (e.g., if ``x`` is ``complex64``, ``logabsdet`` must have a ``float32`` data type).

        Each returned array must have shape ``shape(x)[:-2]``.

    x2: array
        ordinate (or "dependent variable") array ``B``. If ``x2`` has shape ``(M,)``, ``x2`` is equivalent to an array having shape ``(..., M, 1)``.

    The full **singular value decomposition** of an :math:`m \\times n` matrix :math:`x \\in\\ \\mathbb{K}^{m \\times n}` is a factorization of the form

When ``x`` is real-valued, :math:`U`, :math:`V` (and thus :math:`V^H`) are orthogonal, and, when ``x`` is complex, :math:`U`, :math:`V` (and thus :math:`V^H`) are unitary.

    When :math:`m \\gt n` (tall matrix), we can drop the last :math:`m - n` columns of :math:`U` to form the reduced SVD

    Similarly, when :math:`n \\gt m` (wide matrix), we can drop the last :math:`n - m` columns of :math:`V` to also form a reduced SVD.

    This function returns the decomposition :math:`U`, :math:`S`, and :math:`V^H`, where :math:`S = \\operatorname{diag}(\\Sigma)`.

    .. warning::
       The returned arrays :math:`U` and :math:`V` are neither unique nor continuous with respect to ``x``. Because :math:`U` and :math:`V` are not unique, different hardware and software may compute different singular vectors.

       Non-uniqueness stems from the fact that multiplying any pair of singular vectors :math:`u_k`, :math:`v_k` by :math:`-1` when ``x`` is real-valued and by :math:`e^{\\phi j}` (:math:`\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}`) when ``x`` is complex produces another two valid singular vectors of the matrix.

    ----------
    x: array
        input array having shape ``(..., M, N)`` and whose innermost two dimensions form ``MxN`` matrices. Should have a numeric data type.
    offset: int
        offset specifying the off-diagonal relative to the main diagonal.

        -   ``offset = 0``: the main diagonal.
        -   ``offset > 0``: off-diagonal above the main diagonal.
        -   ``offset < 0``: off-diagonal below the main diagonal.

        Default: ``0``.
    dtype: Optional[dtype]
        data type of the returned array. If ``None``, the returned array must have the same data type as ``x``, unless ``x`` has an integer data type supporting a smaller range of values than the default integer data type (e.g., ``x`` has an ``int16`` or ``uint32`` data type and the default integer data type is ``int64``).

    - If ``x1_i`` is a nonzero finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``-x1_i``, the result is ``+0``.
    - In the remaining cases, when neither ``infinity``, ``+0``, ``-0``, nor a ``NaN`` is involved, and the operands have the same mathematical sign or have different magnitudes, the sum must be computed and rounded to the nearest representable value according to IEEE 754-2019 and a supported round mode. If the magnitude is too large to represent, the operation overflows and the result is an `infinity` of appropriate mathematical sign.

    .. note::
       Floating-point addition is a commutative operation, but not always associative.

    For complex floating-point operands, addition is defined according to the following table. For real components ``a`` and ``c`` and imaginary components ``b`` and ``d``,

    +------------+------------+------------+----------------+
    |            | c          | dj         | c + dj         |
    +============+============+============+================+
    | **a**      | a + c      | a + dj     | (a+c) + dj     |
    +------------+------------+------------+----------------+
    | **bj**     | c + bj     | (b+d)j     | c + (b+d)j     |
    +------------+------------+------------+----------------+
    | **a + bj** | (a+c) + bj | a + (b+d)j | (a+c) + (b+d)j |
    +------------+------------+------------+----------------+

    For complex floating-point operands, real-valued floating-point special cases must independently apply to the real and imaginary component operations involving real numbers as described in the above table. For example, let ``a = real(x1_i)``, ``b = imag(x1_i)``, ``c = real(x2_i)``, ``d = imag(x2_i)``, and

    - If ``a`` is ``-0`` and ``c`` is ``-0``, the real component of the result is ``-0``.
    - Similarly, if ``b`` is ``+0`` and ``d`` is ``-0``, the imaginary component of the result is ``+0``.

    Hence, if ``z1 = a + bj = -0 + 0j`` and ``z2 = c + dj = -0 - 0j``, the result of ``z1 + z2`` is ``-0 + 0j``.

    - If ``x1_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``-infinity``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have the same mathematical sign and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a positive mathematical sign.
    - If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have different mathematical signs and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a negative mathematical sign.
    - In the remaining cases, where neither ``-infinity``, ``+0``, ``-0``, nor ``NaN`` is involved, the quotient must be computed and rounded to the nearest representable value according to IEEE 754-2019 and a supported rounding mode. If the magnitude is too large to represent, the operation overflows and the result is an ``infinity`` of appropriate mathematical sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the operation underflows and the result is a zero of appropriate mathematical sign.

    For complex floating-point operands, division is defined according to the following table. For real components ``a`` and ``c`` and imaginary components ``b`` and ``d``,

    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    |            | c              | dj              | c + dj                   |
    +============+================+=================+==========================+
    | **a**      | a / c          | -(a/d)j         | special rules            |
    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    | **bj**     | (b/c)j         | b/d             | special rules            |
    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    | **a + bj** | (a/c) + (b/c)j | b/d - (a/d)j    | special rules            |
    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+

    In general, for complex floating-point operands, real-valued floating-point special cases must independently apply to the real and imaginary component operations involving real numbers as described in the above table.

    When ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, or ``d`` are all finite numbers (i.e., a value other than ``NaN``, ``+infinity``, or ``-infinity``), division of complex floating-point operands should be computed as if calculated according to the textbook formula for complex number division

    .. math::
       \\frac{a + bj}{c + dj} = \\frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)j}{c^2 + d^2}

    When at least one of ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, or ``d`` is ``NaN``, ``+infinity``, or ``-infinity``,

    - If ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, and ``d`` are all ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN + NaN j``.
    - In the remaining cases, the result is implementation dependent.

    .. note::
       For complex floating-point operands, the results of special cases may be implementation dependent depending on how an implementation chooses to model complex numbers and complex infinity (e.g., complex plane versus Riemann sphere). For those implementations following C99 and its one-infinity model, when at least one component is infinite, even if the other component is ``NaN``, the complex value is infinite, and the usual arithmetic rules do not apply to complex-complex division. In the interest of performance, other implementations may want to avoid the complex branching logic necessary to implement the one-infinity model and choose to implement all complex-complex division according to the textbook formula. Accordingly, special case behavior is unlikely to be consistent across implementations.

    **Special cases**

    .. note::
       Floor division was introduced in Python via `PEP 238 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/>`_ with the goal to disambiguate "true division" (i.e., computing an approximation to the mathematical operation of division) from "floor division" (i.e., rounding the result of division toward negative infinity). The former was computed when one of the operands was a ``float``, while the latter was computed when both operands were ``int``\\s. Overloading the ``/`` operator to support both behaviors led to subtle numerical bugs when integers are possible, but not expected.

       To resolve this ambiguity, ``/`` was designated for true division, and ``//`` was designated for floor division. Semantically, floor division was `defined <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/#semantics-of-floor-division>`_ as equivalent to ``a // b == floor(a/b)``; however, special floating-point cases were left ill-defined.

       Accordingly, floor division is not implemented consistently across array libraries for some of the special cases documented below. Namely, when one of the operands is ``infinity``, libraries may diverge with some choosing to strictly follow ``floor(a/b)`` and others choosing to pair ``//`` with ``%`` according to the relation ``b = a % b + b * (a // b)``. The special cases leading to divergent behavior are documented below.

       This specification prefers floor division to match ``floor(divide(x1, x2))`` in order to avoid surprising and unexpected results; however, array libraries may choose to more strictly follow Python behavior.

    For floating-point operands,

    - If either ``x1_i`` or ``x2_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is ``+0`` and ``x2_i`` is greater than ``0``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is greater than ``0``, the result is ``-0``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is ``+0`` and ``x2_i`` is less than ``0``, the result is ``-0``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is less than ``0``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is greater than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``+infinity``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is greater than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``-infinity``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is less than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``-infinity``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is less than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``+infinity``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is ``+infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``+infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)
    - If ``x1_i`` is ``+infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``-infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)
    - If ``x1_i`` is ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``-infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)
    - If ``x1_i`` is ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``+infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)
    - If ``x1_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``-infinity``, the result is ``-0``. (**note**: libraries may return ``-1.0`` to match Python behavior.)
    - If ``x1_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``-0``. (**note**: libraries may return ``-1.0`` to match Python behavior.)
    - If ``x1_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``-infinity``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have the same mathematical sign and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a positive mathematical sign.
    - If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have different mathematical signs and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a negative mathematical sign.
    - In the remaining cases, where neither ``-infinity``, ``+0``, ``-0``, nor ``NaN`` is involved, the quotient must be computed and rounded to the greatest (i.e., closest to `+infinity`) representable integer-value number that is not greater than the division result. If the magnitude is too large to represent, the operation overflows and the result is an ``infinity`` of appropriate mathematical sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the operation underflows and the result is a zero of appropriate mathematical sign.

    **Special Cases**

    For real-valued floating-point operands,

    - If ``x1_i`` is ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is any value, including ``NaN``, the result is ``+infinity``.
    - If ``x2_i`` is ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``x1_i`` is any value, including ``NaN``, the result is ``+infinity``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0``, the result is equivalent to ``abs(x2_i)``.
    - If ``x2_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0``, the result is equivalent to ``abs(x1_i)``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is a finite number or ``NaN`` and ``x2_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x2_i`` is a finite number or ``NaN`` and ``x1_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - Underflow may only occur when both arguments are subnormal and the correct result is also subnormal.

    For real-valued floating-point operands, ``hypot(x1, x2)`` must equal ``hypot(x2, x1)``, ``hypot(x1, -x2)``, ``hypot(-x1, x2)``, and ``hypot(-x1, -x2)``.

    .. note::
       IEEE 754-2019 requires support for subnormal (a.k.a., denormal) numbers, which are useful for supporting gradual underflow. However, hardware support for subnormal numbers is not universal, and many platforms (e.g., accelerators) and compilers support toggling denormals-are-zero (DAZ) and/or flush-to-zero (FTZ) behavior to increase performance and to guard against timing attacks.

       Accordingly, conforming implementations may vary in their support for subnormal numbers.

       The natural logarithm is a continuous function from above the branch cut, taking into account the sign of the imaginary component.

       Accordingly, for complex arguments, the function returns the natural logarithm in the range of a strip in the interval :math:`[-\\pi j, +\\pi j]` along the imaginary axis and mathematically unbounded along the real axis.

    x: array
        input array. Should have a floating-point data type.

    - If ``x1_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have the same mathematical sign, the result has a positive mathematical sign, unless the result is ``NaN``. If the result is ``NaN``, the "sign" of ``NaN`` is implementation-defined.
    - If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have different mathematical signs, the result has a negative mathematical sign, unless the result is ``NaN``. If the result is ``NaN``, the "sign" of ``NaN`` is implementation-defined.
    - If ``x1_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is a signed infinity with the mathematical sign determined by the rule already stated above.
    - If ``x1_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a nonzero finite number, the result is a signed infinity with the mathematical sign determined by the rule already stated above.
    - If ``x1_i`` is a nonzero finite number and ``x2_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is a signed infinity with the mathematical sign determined by the rule already stated above.
    - In the remaining cases, where neither ``infinity`` nor ``NaN`` is involved, the product must be computed and rounded to the nearest representable value according to IEEE 754-2019 and a supported rounding mode. If the magnitude is too large to represent, the result is an `infinity` of appropriate mathematical sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the result is a zero of appropriate mathematical sign.

    For complex floating-point operands, multiplication is defined according to the following table. For real components ``a`` and ``c`` and imaginary components ``b`` and ``d``,

    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    |            | c              | dj              | c + dj                   |
    +============+================+=================+==========================+
    | **a**      | a * c          | (a*d)j          | (a*c) + (a*d)j           |
    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    | **bj**     | (b*c)j         | -(b*d)          | -(b*d) + (b*c)j          |
    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+
    | **a + bj** | (a*c) + (b*c)j | -(b*d) + (a*d)j | special rules            |
    +------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------------------+

    In general, for complex floating-point operands, real-valued floating-point special cases must independently apply to the real and imaginary component operations involving real numbers as described in the above table.

    When ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, or ``d`` are all finite numbers (i.e., a value other than ``NaN``, ``+infinity``, or ``-infinity``), multiplication of complex floating-point operands should be computed as if calculated according to the textbook formula for complex number multiplication

    .. math::
       (a + bj) \\cdot (c + dj) = (ac - bd) + (bc + ad)j

    When at least one of ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, or ``d`` is ``NaN``, ``+infinity``, or ``-infinity``,

    - If ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, and ``d`` are all ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN + NaN j``.
    - In the remaining cases, the result is implementation dependent.

    .. note::
       For complex floating-point operands, the results of special cases may be implementation dependent depending on how an implementation chooses to model complex numbers and complex infinity (e.g., complex plane versus Riemann sphere). For those implementations following C99 and its one-infinity model, when at least one component is infinite, even if the other component is ``NaN``, the complex value is infinite, and the usual arithmetic rules do not apply to complex-complex multiplication. In the interest of performance, other implementations may want to avoid the complex branching logic necessary to implement the one-infinity model and choose to implement all complex-complex multiplication according to the textbook formula. Accordingly, special case behavior is unlikely to be consistent across implementations.

          \\begin{align} \\operatorname{tan}(x) &= \\frac{j(e^{-jx} - e^{jx})}{e^{-jx} + e^{jx}} \\\\ &= (-1) \\frac{j(e^{jx} - e^{-jx})}{e^{jx} + e^{-jx}} \\\\ &= -j \\cdot \\operatorname{tanh}(jx) \\end{align}

       where :math:`\\operatorname{tanh}` is the hyperbolic tangent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array whose elements are expressed in radians. Should have a floating-point data type.

    Returns
    -------
    out: array
        an array containing the tangent of each element in ``x``. The returned array must have a floating-point data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion`.

    Notes
    -----
    **Special cases**

    For real-valued floating-point operands,

    - If ``x_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``-0``.
    - If ``x_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is ``NaN``.

    For complex floating-point operands, special cases must be handled as if the operation is implemented as ``-1j * tanh(x*1j)``.

@runtime_checkable
class tanh[TArray: Array](Protocol):
    r"""
    Calculates an implementation-dependent approximation to the hyperbolic tangent for each element ``x_i`` of the input array ``x``.

    The mathematical definition of the hyperbolic tangent is

    .. math::
       \\begin{align} \\operatorname{tanh}(x) &= \\frac{\\operatorname{sinh}(x)}{\\operatorname{cosh}(x)} \\\\ &= \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} \\end{align}

    where :math:`\\operatorname{sinh}(x)` is the hyperbolic sine and :math:`\\operatorname{cosh}(x)` is the hyperbolic cosine.

    .. note::
       The hyperbolic tangent is an analytical function on the complex plane and has no branch cuts. The function is periodic, with period :math:`\\pi j`, with respect to the imaginary component and has first order poles along the imaginary line at coordinates :math:`(0, \\pi (\\frac{1}{2} + n))`. However, IEEE 754 binary floating-point representation cannot represent :math:`\\pi / 2` exactly, and, thus, no argument value is possible such that a pole error occurs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array whose elements each represent a hyperbolic angle. Should have a floating-point data type.

    Returns
    -------
    out: array
        an array containing the hyperbolic tangent of each element in ``x``. The returned array must have a floating-point data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion`.

    Notes
    -----
    **Special cases**

    .. note::
       For all operands, ``tanh(-x)`` must equal ``-tanh(x)``.

    For real-valued floating-point operands,

    - If ``x_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``-0``.
    - If ``x_i`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``+1``.
    - If ``x_i`` is ``-infinity``, the result is ``-1``.

    For complex floating-point operands, let ``a = real(x_i)``, ``b = imag(x_i)``, and

    .. note::
       For complex floating-point operands, ``tanh(conj(x))`` must equal ``conj(tanh(x))``.

    - If ``a`` is ``+0`` and ``b`` is ``+0``, the result is ``+0 + 0j``.
    - If ``a`` is a nonzero finite number and ``b`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``NaN + NaN j``.
    - If ``a`` is ``+0`` and ``b`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``+0 + NaN j``.
    - If ``a`` is a nonzero finite number and ``b`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN + NaN j``.
    - If ``a`` is ``+0`` and ``b`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``+0 + NaN j``.
    - If ``a`` is ``+infinity`` and ``b`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``1 + 0j``.
    - If ``a`` is ``+infinity`` and ``b`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``1 + 0j`` (sign of the imaginary component is unspecified).
    - If ``a`` is ``+infinity`` and ``b`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``1 + 0j`` (sign of the imaginary component is unspecified).
    - If ``a`` is ``NaN`` and ``b`` is ``+0``, the result is ``NaN + 0j``.
    - If ``a`` is ``NaN`` and ``b`` is a nonzero number, the result is ``NaN + NaN j``.
    - If ``a`` is ``NaN`` and ``b`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN + NaN j``.

    .. warning::
       For historical reasons stemming from the C standard, array libraries may not return the expected result when ``a`` is ``+0`` and ``b`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``NaN``. The result should be ``+0 + NaN j`` in both cases; however, for libraries compiled against older C versions, the result may be ``NaN + NaN j``.

       Array libraries are not required to patch these older C versions, and, thus, users are advised that results may vary across array library implementations for these special cases.

        When ``repeats`` is an array, the shape of the output array for this function depends on the data values in the ``repeats`` array; hence, array libraries which build computation graphs (e.g., JAX, Dask, etc.) may find this function difficult to implement without knowing the values in ``repeats``. Accordingly, such libraries may choose to omit support for ``repeats`` arrays; however, conforming implementations must support providing a literal ``int``. See :ref:`data-dependent-output-shapes` section for more details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array
        input array containing elements to repeat.
    repeats: Union[int, array]
        the number of repetitions for each element.

        If ``axis`` is ``None``, let ``N = prod(x.shape)`` and

        -   if ``repeats`` is an array, ``repeats`` must be broadcast compatible with the shape ``(N,)`` (i.e., be a one-dimensional array having shape ``(1,)`` or ``(N,)``).
        -   if ``repeats`` is an integer, ``repeats`` must be broadcasted to the shape `(N,)`.

        If ``axis`` is not ``None``, let ``M = x.shape[axis]`` and

        -   if ``repeats`` is an array, ``repeats`` must be broadcast compatible with the shape ``(M,)`` (i.e., be a one-dimensional array having shape ``(1,)`` or ``(M,)``).
        -   if ``repeats`` is an integer, ``repeats`` must be broadcasted to the shape ``(M,)``.

        If ``repeats`` is an array, the array must have an integer data type.

        .. note::
           For specification-conforming array libraries supporting hardware acceleration, providing an array for ``repeats`` may cause device synchronization due to an unknown output shape. For those array libraries where synchronization concerns are applicable, conforming array libraries are advised to include a warning in their documentation regarding potential performance degradation when ``repeats`` is an array.

        :class: important

    .. note::
       Uniqueness should be determined based on value equality (see :func:`~array_api.equal`). For input arrays having floating-point data types, value-based equality implies the following behavior.

       -   As ``nan`` values compare as ``False``, ``nan`` values should be considered distinct.

       As signed zeros are not distinct, using ``inverse_indices`` to reconstruct the input array is not guaranteed to return an array having the exact same values.

       Each ``nan`` value and each complex floating-point value having a ``nan`` component should have a count of one, while the counts for signed zeros should be aggregated as a single count.

The former was computed when one of the operands was a ``float``, while the latter was computed when both operands were ``int``\\s. Overloading the ``/`` operator to support both behaviors led to subtle numerical bugs when integers are possible, but not expected.\n\n   To resolve this ambiguity, ``/`` was designated for true division, and ``//`` was designated for floor division. Semantically, floor division was `defined <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/#semantics-of-floor-division>`_ as equivalent to ``a // b == floor(a/b)``; however, special floating-point cases were left ill-defined.\n\n   Accordingly, floor division is not implemented consistently across array libraries for some of the special cases documented below. Namely, when one of the operands is ``infinity``, libraries may diverge with some choosing to strictly follow ``floor(a/b)`` and others choosing to pair ``//`` with ``%`` according to the relation ``b = a % b + b * (a // b)``. The special cases leading to divergent behavior are documented below.\n\n   This specification prefers floor division to match ``floor(divide(x1, x2))`` in order to avoid surprising and unexpected results; however, array libraries may choose to more strictly follow Python behavior.\n\nFor floating-point operands,\n\n- If either ``x1_i`` or ``x2_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.\n- If ``x1_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is ``NaN``.\n- If ``x1_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0``, the result is ``NaN``.\n- If ``x1_i`` is ``+0`` and ``x2_i`` is greater than ``0``, the result is ``+0``.\n- If ``x1_i`` is ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is greater than ``0``, the result is ``-0``.\n- If ``x1_i`` is ``+0`` and ``x2_i`` is less than ``0``, the result is ``-0``.\n- If ``x1_i`` is ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is less than ``0``, the result is ``+0``.\n- If ``x1_i`` is greater than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``+infinity``.\n- If ``x1_i`` is greater than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``-infinity``.\n- If ``x1_i`` is less than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``-infinity``.\n- If ``x1_i`` is less than ``0`` and ``x2_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``+infinity``.\n- If ``x1_i`` is ``+infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``+infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)\n- If ``x1_i`` is ``+infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``-infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)\n- If ``x1_i`` is ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``-infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)\n- If ``x1_i`` is ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``+infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)\n- If ``x1_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``+0``.\n- If ``x1_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``-infinity``, the result is ``-0``. (**note**: libraries may return ``-1.0`` to match Python behavior.)\n- If ``x1_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``-0``. (**note**: libraries may return ``-1.0`` to match Python behavior.)\n- If ``x1_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``-infinity``, the result is ``+0``.\n- If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have the same mathematical sign and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a positive mathematical sign.\n- If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have different mathematical signs and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a negative mathematical sign.\n- In the remaining cases, where neither ``-infinity``, ``+0``, ``-0``, nor ``NaN`` is involved, the quotient must be computed and rounded to the greatest (i.e., closest to `+infinity`) representable integer-value number that is not greater than the division result. If the magnitude is too large to represent, the operation overflows and the result is an ``infinity`` of appropriate mathematical sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the operation underflows and the result is a zero of appropriate mathematical sign.'
