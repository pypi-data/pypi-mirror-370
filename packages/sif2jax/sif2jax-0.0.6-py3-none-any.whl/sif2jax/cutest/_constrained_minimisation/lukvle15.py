    """LUKVLE15 - Chained modified HS50 problem.

    Problem 5.15 from Luksan and Vlcek test problems.

    The objective is a chained modified HS50 function:
    f(x) = Σ[i=1 to (n-1)/4] [(x_{j+1} - x_{j+2})^2 + (x_{j+2} - x_{j+3})^2 +
                               (x_{j+3} - x_{j+4})^4 + (x_{j+4} - x_{j+5})^4]
    where j = 4(i-1), l = 4*div(k-1,3)

    Subject to equality constraints:
    c_k(x) = x_{l+1}^2 + 2x_{l+2} + 3x_{l+3} - 6 = 0, for k ≡ 1 (mod 3), 1 ≤ k ≤ n_C
    c_k(x) = x_{l+2}^2 + 2x_{l+3} + 3x_{l+4} - 6 = 0, for k ≡ 2 (mod 3), 1 ≤ k ≤ n_C
    c_k(x) = x_{l+3}^2 + 2x_{l+4} + 3x_{l+5} - 6 = 0, for k ≡ 0 (mod 3), 1 ≤ k ≤ n_C
    where n_C = 3(n-1)/4

    Starting point:
    x_i = 35.0 for i ≡ 1 (mod 4)
    x_i = 11.0 for i ≡ 2 (mod 4)
    x_i = 5.0 for i ≡ 3 (mod 4)
    x_i = -5.0 for i ≡ 0 (mod 4)
