# TODO: human review required - this is a simplified approximation

class HIELOW(AbstractUnconstrainedMinimisation):
    """Hierarchical logit model for modal choice prediction.

    TODO: This implementation requires human review and may need substantial rework.

    This file implements a simplified approximation of the HIELOW problem from CUTEst.
    The actual implementation requires access to a FORTRAN subroutine named "HIELOW"
    which is called in the SIF file but not included in it. The SIF file contains:

    ```fortran
    DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION F(B1,B2,B3)
    ...
    CALL HIELOW(.FALSE.,.FALSE.)
    ```

    The HIELOW problem models a hierarchical logit function for transportation choice:
    - Car
    - Public transportation (with Theta0/THE1 parameter)
      - Bus
      - Tram

    The coefficients represent:
    - BET1, BET2: Elemental coefficients affecting utility functions
      (related to time and cost)
    - THE1: A structural coefficient for the hierarchical model's nesting structure

    Without the actual FORTRAN implementation, this file provides only an approximate
    implementation based on general hierarchical logit model principles. The results
    may not match the original CUTEst problem.

    This problem involves finding the parameters of a hierarchical logit
    model that maximize the likelihood of a sample of observations.

    Description of the model:
    - Hierarchical structure with car and public transportation options
    - Public transportation includes bus and tram
    - Three parameters: two elemental coefficients (BET1, BET2)
      and one structural coefficient (THE1)
