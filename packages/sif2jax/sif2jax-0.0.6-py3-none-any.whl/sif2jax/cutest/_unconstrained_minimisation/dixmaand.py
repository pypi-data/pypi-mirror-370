    """Dixon-Maany test problem (version D).

    This is a variable-dimension unconstrained optimization problem from the
    Dixon-Maany family. It includes all four term types with higher powers
    of (i/n) in the weights.

    The objective function includes quadratic terms, quartic terms,
    bilinear terms, and sin terms.
