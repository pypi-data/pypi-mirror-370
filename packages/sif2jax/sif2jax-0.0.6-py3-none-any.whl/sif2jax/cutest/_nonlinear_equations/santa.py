    """
    The Santa problem as suggested in a Christmas competition by Jens Jensen
    (Scientific Computing, STFC).

    Santa is flying around the world, presently presenting presents. The Earth is
    modeled as a perfect sphere with radius precisely 6,371,000 metres. Santa sets
    off from the North Pole along 2Â°6'57.6" E bearing south and visits various
    locations, leaving an elf behind at each
    location to help unwrap presents.

    The problem is to find Santa's route given the distances traveled between locations.
    The constraints are given by the spherical law of cosines:
    sin phi_1 sin phi_2 + cos phi_1 cos phi_2 cos(lam_1 - lam_2) = cos(d/r)

    The problem has many local minimizers of the sum of squares of infeasibility,
    but only the solution with zero residuals is of interest.
