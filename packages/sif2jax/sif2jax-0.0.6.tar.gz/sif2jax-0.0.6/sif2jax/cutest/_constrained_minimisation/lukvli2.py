    """LUKVLI2 - Chained Wood function with Broyden banded inequality constraints.

    Problem 5.2 from Luksan and Vlcek test problems with inequality constraints.

    The objective is a chained Wood function:
    f(x) = Σ[i=1 to n/2-1] [100(x_{2i-1}^2 - x_{2i})^2 + (x_{2i-1} - 1)^2 +
                             90(x_{2i+1}^2 - x_{2i+2})^2 + (x_{2i+1} - 1)^2 +
                             10(x_{2i} + x_{2i+2} - 2)^2 + (x_{2i} - x_{2i+2})^2/10]

    Subject to inequality constraints:
    c_k(x) = (2 + 5x_{k+5}^2)x_{k+5} + 1 + Σ[i=k-5 to k+1] x_i(1 + x_i) ≤ 0,
    for k = 6, ..., n-2 (with appropriate adjustments for boundary cases)

    Starting point: x_i = -2 for i odd, x_i = 1 for i even
