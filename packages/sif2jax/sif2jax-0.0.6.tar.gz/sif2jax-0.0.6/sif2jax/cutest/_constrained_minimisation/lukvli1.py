    """LUKVLI1 - Chained Rosenbrock function with trigonometric-exponential constraints.

    Problem 5.1 from Luksan and Vlcek test problems with inequality constraints.

    The objective is a chained Rosenbrock function:
    f(x) = Σ[i=1 to n-1] [100(x_i^2 - x_{i+1})^2 + (x_i - 1)^2]

    Subject to inequality constraints:
    c_k(x) = 3x_{k+1}^3 + 2x_{k+2} - 5 + sin(x_{k+1} - x_{k+2})sin(x_{k+1} + x_{k+2})
             + 4x_{k+1} - x_k exp(x_k - x_{k+1}) - 3 ≤ 0, for k = 1, ..., n-2

    Starting point: x_i = -1.2 for i odd, x_i = 1.0 for i even
