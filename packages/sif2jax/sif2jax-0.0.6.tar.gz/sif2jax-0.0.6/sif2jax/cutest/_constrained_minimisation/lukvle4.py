# TODO: Human review needed - SIFDECODE/pycutest discrepancy
# This implementation follows the correct mathematical formula from the paper.
# However, pycutest uses LUKVLE4.SIF which has a bug where group C(I) is defined
# twice - first for the objective tan^4 terms (line 57) and then REDEFINED for
# constraints (lines 64-69). This causes the objective C(I) groups to be overwritten.
# The corrected version LUKVLE4C.SIF exists (uses E(I) for objective tan^4 terms)
# but pycutest doesn't use it, leading to completely different objective values.
# Our objective: ~3M vs pycutest: ~7.2B (factor of ~2380)

    """LUKVLE4 - Chained Cragg-Levy function with tridiagonal constraints.

    Problem 5.4 from Luksan and Vlcek test problems.

    The objective is a chained Cragg-Levy function:
    f(x) = Σ[i=1 to n/2] [(exp(x_{2i-1}) - x_{2i})^4 + 100(x_{2i} - x_{2i+1})^6 +
                          tan^4(x_{2i+1} - x_{2i+2}) + x_{2i-1}^8 + (x_{2i+2} - 1)^2]

    Subject to equality constraints:
    c_k(x) = 8x_{k+1}(x_{k+1}^2 - x_k) - 2(1 - x_{k+1}) + 4(x_{k+1} - x_{k+2}^2) = 0,
    for k = 1, ..., n-2

    Note: Due to a bug in LUKVLE4.SIF, only k = n/2, ..., n-2 are treated as constraints

    Starting point:
    x_i = 1 for i ≡ 1 (mod 4)
    x_i = 2 for i ≢ 1 (mod 4)
