    """LUKVLI10 - Generalized Brown function with Broyden tridiagonal inequality
    constraints.

    Problem 5.10 from Luksan and Vlcek test problems with inequality constraints.

    The objective is a generalized Brown function:
    f(x) = Σ[i=1 to n/2] [(x_{2i-1}^2)^(x_{2i}^2+1) + (x_{2i}^2)^(x_{2i-1}^2+1)]

    Subject to inequality constraints:
    c_k(x) = (3 - 2x_{k+1})x_{k+1} + 1 - x_k - 2x_{k+2} ≤ 0,
    for k = 1, ..., n-2

    Starting point:
    x_i = -1 for i odd
    x_i = 1 for i even
