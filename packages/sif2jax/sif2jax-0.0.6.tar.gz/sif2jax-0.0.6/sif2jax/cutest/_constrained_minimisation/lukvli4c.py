    """LUKVLI4C - Corrected Cragg-Levy function with tridiagonal inequality constraints.

    This is the corrected version of LUKVLI4, fixing the bug where group C(I) was
    defined twice in the original SIF file. The corrected version uses E(I) for the
    tan^4 terms in the objective function.

    TODO: Human review needed - 3% discrepancy with pycutest
    This implementation uses the corrected LUKVLI4C.SIF file which fixes a bug in
    the original LUKVLI4.SIF. While our implementation follows the corrected SIF
    file exactly, there remains a ~3% discrepancy with pycutest (3,020,250.61 vs
    3,112,445.79). Most gradient elements match exactly, but a few near the end
    differ. This may be due to numerical precision differences in tangent
    calculations or subtle SIFDECODE interpretation differences. The corrected
    version is vastly superior to the buggy LUKVLI4 (which has a factor of ~2380
    error), but does not yet achieve exact numerical agreement with pycutest.

    Problem 5.4 from Luksan and Vlcek test problems with inequality constraints.

    The objective is a chained Cragg-Levy function:
    f(x) = Σ[i=1 to n/2-1] [(exp(x_{2i-1}) - x_{2i})^4 + 100(x_{2i} - x_{2i+1})^6 +
                            tan^4(x_{2i+1} - x_{2i+2}) + x_{2i-1}^8 + (x_{2i+2} - 1)^2]

    Subject to inequality constraints:
    c_k(x) = 8x_{k+1}(x_{k+1}^2 - x_k) - 2(1 - x_{k+1}) + 4(x_{k+1} - x_{k+2}^2) ≤ 0,
    for k = 1, ..., n-2

    Starting point:
    x_i = 1 for i ≡ 1 (mod 4)
    x_i = 2 for i ≢ 1 (mod 4)
