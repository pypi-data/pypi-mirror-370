class BROWNBS(AbstractUnconstrainedMinimisation):
    """Brown badly scaled function.

    Brown badly scaled problem in 2 variables.
    This problem is a sum of n-1 sets of 3 groups, one of them involving
    a nonlinear element and all being of the least square type.
    Its Hessian matrix is tridiagonal.
