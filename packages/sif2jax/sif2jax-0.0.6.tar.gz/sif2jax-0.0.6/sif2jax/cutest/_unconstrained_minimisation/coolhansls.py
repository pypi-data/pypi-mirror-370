class COOLHANSLS(AbstractUnconstrainedMinimisation):
    """A problem arising from the analysis of a Cooley-Hansen economy with
    loglinear approximation.

    The problem is to solve the matrix equation
               A * X * X + B * X + C = 0
    where A, B and C are known N times N matrices and X an unknown matrix
    of matching dimension. The instance considered here has N = 3.
