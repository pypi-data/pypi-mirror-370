# pyscaf

A python poetry scaffolder - A tool to quickly initialize Python projects with complete and modern configuration.

## Installation

The `pyscaf` module is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install open-pyscaf
```

Or from the test repository:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple open-pyscaf
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

The usage is simple and interactive:

```bash
pyscaf init --interactive project_name
```

This command initializes a project named `project_name` by asking you a few questions about the project nature.

### Command Line Arguments

You can also provide arguments directly on the command line to avoid interactive questions:

```bash
pyscaf init --interactive test-versioning --versionning --remote-url tada.github --no-install
```

This allows you to:
- Set project name: `test-versioning`
- Enable versioning: `--versionning`
- Set remote URL: `--remote-url tada.github`
- Skip installation: `--no-install`
