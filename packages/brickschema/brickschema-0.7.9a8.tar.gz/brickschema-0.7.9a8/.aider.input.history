+clean up and fix the logic for validate and expand so that they use the fastest engine available. For "owlrl" the fastest engines are: reasonable, allegrograph, owlrl. For "shacl" the fastest engines are: topquadrant, pyshacl.

+add a min_iterations and max_iterations to the graph.expand function, which will get used in the shacl part. the brick-tq-shacl infer method takes min_iterations and max_iterations as arguments. pyshacl doesn't, so we will need to emulate that ourselves

# 2025-08-12 08:04:34.666883
+let's actually move the SHACL expansion stuff to a new method called "compile". Keep the owl stuff where it is
