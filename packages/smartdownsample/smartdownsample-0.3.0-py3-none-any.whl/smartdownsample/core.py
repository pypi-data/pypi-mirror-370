    Fast image selection using simple grid-based diversity.
    Always returns exactly target_count images in seconds, not hours.
    
    Strategy:
    1. Compute quick hashes for all images
    2. Group similar images into buckets
    3. Sample evenly from buckets to maintain diversity
    
    Args:
        image_paths: List of paths to images
        target_count: Exact number of images to return
        hash_size: Size of perceptual hash (8 is fast and good enough)
        n_workers: Number of parallel workers (default: 4)
        show_progress: Whether to show progress bars
        random_seed: Random seed for reproducibility
        
    Returns:
        List of exactly target_count selected image paths
        
    Examples:
        >>> # Fast selection of 100 from 24,000 images
        >>> selected = select_distinct(image_paths, target_count=100)
        
        >>> # Also fast selection of 23,000 from 24,000 images
