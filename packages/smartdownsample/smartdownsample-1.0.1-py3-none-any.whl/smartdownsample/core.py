    Fast diverse sampling from large image collections.
    Preserves maximum diversity by trimming only from largest buckets.
    
    Strategy:
    1. Compute quick hashes for all images
    2. Group similar images into buckets (~16 visual groups)
    3. Trim from top: Keep all small buckets, trim largest buckets with stride sampling
    
    Args:
        image_paths: List of paths to images
        target_count: Exact number of images to return
        hash_size: Size of perceptual hash (8 is fast and good enough)
        n_workers: Number of parallel workers (default: 4)
        show_progress: Whether to show progress bars
        random_seed: Random seed for reproducibility
        
    Returns:
        List of exactly target_count selected image paths
        
    Examples:
        >>> # Fast diverse sampling of 100 from 24,000 images
        >>> selected = sample_diverse(image_paths, target_count=100)
        
        >>> # Also fast for large selections like 23,000 from 24,000 images
