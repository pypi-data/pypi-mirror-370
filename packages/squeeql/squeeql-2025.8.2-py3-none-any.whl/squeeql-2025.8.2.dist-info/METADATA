# SqueeQL

Simple utilities for working with SQLite in Python.

## History

SqueeQL was started to improve and make available as a PyPI package the
[Simple declarative schema migration for SQLite](https://david.rothlis.net/declarative-schema-migration-for-sqlite/)
code written by William Manley. The original MIT licensed code is available at
that link, or can be found at the initial commit
`9577b1e60908019e8c53efc4582d504d57fffff6` in this repository. All further
