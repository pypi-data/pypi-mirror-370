msl_profile
============

To help develop new models we provide the tool `msl_profile` (formerly `macsyprofile`) which is to be used as post treatement.

It is ran over a previous <macsylib> analysis:

   * it extracts from raw HMMER output files the hits and computes the profile coverage for each of them.
   * it enables to filter the hits in a user-defined manner, to test other values of filtering parameters than those used with the MacSyLib run.
   * it writes down the results in a file in `tsv` format `hmm_coverage.tsv`.

                            <macsylib>.log) (default: False)

    For more details, visit the MacSyLib website and see the MacSyLib documentation.

For instance:

.. code-block:: shell

    >msl_profile  <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX

will analyse the HMMER raw outputs stored in `<macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmmer_results` directory
and the results will be stored in `<macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmm_coverage.tsv` file


Setting filtering parameters
----------------------------

This helper tool is designed to help the user test the relevance of the HMM profiles used, what filtering parameters for HMMER to be used,
and understand why some components might be unexpectedly missing from the MacSyLib results.
This can thus help to improve the models - for instance for the genomic location parameters (is a component not found cause it should be listed as a `loner`?).

Therefore by default, the filtering parameters are very loose so that most hits found with HMMER will be reported, even the weakest ones.

However, it is possible to filter hits to be extracted based on the profile coverage with `--coverage-profile` or the i-evalue (`--i-evalue-sel`) to be a bit more stringent.

Also, it is possible to use the `--best-hits` in order to report only the best hit for a given protein sequence when several profiles were matching hit.


Using patterns with "--pattern"
-------------------------------

If in `previous_run/hmmer_results` you have the following files:

.. code-block:: text

    previous_run/hmmer_results/Archaeal-T4P_arCOG11238.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/Archaeal-T4P_arCOG11520.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/Archaeal-T4P_arCOG11777.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/Archaeal-T4P_arCOG11778.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/Archaeal-T4P_arCOG11936.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/Archaeal-T4P_arCOG14515.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/ComM_comC.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/ComM_comEB.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/ComM_comEC.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/ComM_comGA.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/ComM_comGB.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/ComM_comGC.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/ComM_comGD.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/ComM_comGE.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/MSH_mshA.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/MSH_mshB.search_hmm.out
    previous_run/hmmer_results/MSH_mshC.search_hmm.out


But you are interested only in ComM family genes, you can specify the option ``--pattern 'ComM*'``
For instance:

.. code-block:: text

    >msl_profile --pattern 'ComM*'  <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX
    parsing <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmmer_results/ComM_comB.search_hmm.out
    parsing <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmmer_results/ComM_comC.search_hmm.out
    parsing <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmmer_results/ComM_comEA.search_hmm.out
    parsing <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmmer_results/ComM_comEB.search_hmm.out
    parsing <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmmer_results/ComM_comEC.search_hmm.out
    parsing <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmmer_results/ComM_comGA.search_hmm.out
    parsing <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmmer_results/ComM_comGB.search_hmm.out
    parsing <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmmer_results/ComM_comGC.search_hmm.out
    parsing <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmmer_results/ComM_comGD.search_hmm.out
    parsing <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmmer_results/ComM_comGE.search_hmm.out
    found 79 hits
    result is in 'macsylib-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmm_coverage.tsv'

.. note::

    The patterns available are the `glob` patterns (the jokers usable with unix `ls` command )

    .. code-block:: text

        >msl_profile --pattern 'ComM_com?C' -f <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX
        parsing <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmmer_results/ComM_comEC.search_hmm.out
        parsing <macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmmer_results/ComM_comGC.search_hmm.out
        found 16 hits
        result is in '<macsylib>-2021XXXX_XX-XX-XX/hmm_coverage.tsv'

.. note::

    <macsylib> can be replace by the name of a program if macsylib is used in higher tool (as *macsyfinder*).
    Just specify the prog_name in :class:`macsylib.config.MacsyDefault` object.


A useful example for modellers?
-------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

    >msl_profile --best-hits i_eval --i-evalue-sel 0.001 --coverage-profile 0.5 -o msf_GCF_003149495.1_ASM314949v1_tff-sf/hmm_coverage_best-hits_ieval_default_filter_MSF.tsv msf_GCF_003149495.1_ASM314949v1_tff-sf
    found 221 hits
    result is in 'msf_GCF_003149495.1_ASM314949v1_tff-sf/hmm_coverage_best-hits_ieval_default_filter_MSF.tsv'

This command line might be useful to macsy-models modellers, as it consists in extracting all relevant hits that are used by
the MacSyLib engine to search systems, when using the default parameters:

- the proteins are assigned with their best hits (i-evalue based) when they match several profiles (`--best-hits i_eval` option)
- the default filtering parameters (i-evalue and profile coverage) are used (`--i-evalue-sel` and `--coverage-profile` options)

By using this command line that lists all hits available for MacSyLib to search for systems, one could be interested in
comparing this list to the list of hits that end in being assigned to systems (listed e.g. in best_solution.tsv).
This can help to determine why a component is missing from a system: is it because there are no good hits for it, or
is it because it does not comply to the co-localization rules defined in the systems' model?




Parsing msl_profile outputs
----------------------------

The `msl_profile` output is a tabulated separated values (`.tsv`) files
The first lines which are comments (starting with '#') display the tool version
and the complete command line used. Then follow the results.
The first line of results is a header line.

.. code-block:: text

    # msl_profile 2.1.5
    # msl_profile --pattern ComM* --coverage-profile 0.5 <macsylib>-20201202_15-17-46/
    hit_id  replicon_name   position_hit    hit_sequence_length     gene_name       i_eval  score   profile_coverage        sequence_coverage       begin   end
    GCF_000006745_021980    GCF_000006745   2198    291     ComM_comC       2.500e-40       136.400 0.942   0.708   62      267
    GCF_000006745_007650    GCF_000006745   765     253     ComM_comC       9.600e-31       105.100 0.937   0.798   43      244
    ...


.. note::
    This file can be easily parsed using the Python `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ library. ::

        import pandas as pd

        systems = pd.read_csv("path/to/hmm_coverage.tsv", sep='\t', comment='#')




.. warning::

    The `msl_profile` tool is not compliant with results produced with `macsyfinder v1`.
    If you get ``Cannot find models in conf file XXX. May be these results have been generated with an old version of macsyfinder.``
    Check the configuration file, if `[models]` section contains ``models_1 = XXX YYY`` remove the `_1` from models
    ``models = XXX YYY``
