"""
The pyav container stores the information based
on the packets timestamps (called 'pts'). Some
of the packets are considered key_frames because
they include those key frames.

Also, this library uses those key frames to start
decodifying from there to the next one, obtaining
all the frames in between able to be read and
modified.

This cache system will look for the range of 
frames that belong to the key frame related to the
frame we are requesting in the moment, keeping in
memory all those frames to be handled fast. It
will remove the old frames if needed to use only
the 'size' we set when creating it.
