Probably mostly in order
1) Fully flesh out the project configs and how that plays into system setup
2) Add `arm-cli system install-tools` for easy configuration of new machines
3) Add additional tab completes
4) Additional integration tests on project setup
5) Deployment tools - possibly using ansible or maybe save that for later
6) Connect to container registries for skill install
7) More comprehensive documentation of intent
8) Explore alternative interactive CLI libraries (e.g., questionary) for better page size control in menus

These are probably not all-encompassing, but it's what I am thinking about right now.

Other ideas
* Ansible
* LLM project configuration assistant - connection to skill docs
* ARM checks in CI - probably no reason to, but it does need to work there
