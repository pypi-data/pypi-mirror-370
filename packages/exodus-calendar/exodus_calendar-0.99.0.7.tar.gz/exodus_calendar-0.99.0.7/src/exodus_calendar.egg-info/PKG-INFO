# EXODUS CALENDAR FOR MARS
Revision 2025.08.19

## INTRODUCTION
An accurate and user-friendly Martian calendar would be invaluable for future Martian
colonists, yet no commonly accepted system exists today. Current proposals, such as the
Darian calendar [1], may appear overly complex and demand memorization of numerous
unfamiliar terms. The ideal Martian calendar should combine both accuracy and simplicity, retaining familiar month and weekday names. Additionally, maintaining some degree of
backwards compatibility with existing Martian timekeeping solutions would be highly beneficial.


## DESCRIPTION
I propose the following scheme:

Using the northward equinox year (668.5907 sols) as the reference year length, this
calendar operates on a 22-year cycle:
- Ten 668-sol years (even-numbered years: second, fourth, sixth, etc.)
- Eleven 669-sol years (odd-numbered years: first, third, fifth, etc.)
- One 670-sol year (leap year)

In one sentence, rephrased: _odd years are 669 sols, even years are 668 sols except when divisible by 22, then they are 670 sol long._

Each year comprises 12 months bearing the same names as their terrestrial counterparts,
with each containing 56 sols except December, which varies in length: 52, 53, or 54 sols.
Weeks maintain the familiar seven-day structure with Earth‚Äôs weekday names (Monday,
Tuesday, etc.), and each month contains exactly eight weeks. All months begin on Monday
and conclude on Sunday, with only December's final week ending on Wednesday,
Thursday, or Friday, depending on the year's length. Every new year begins on Monday.

### ACCURACY

_Calendar Year Length=(668 x 10 + 669 x 11 + 670)/22_

This yields an average calendar year duration of 668.5909(09) sols, creating a naive error estimate of 0.00021 sols per year, comparable to the Gregorian calendar's 0.00013-day annual discrepancy. If no other factors take into account, such a system would remain reasonably accurate for the foreseeable future, accumulating an error of only 1 sol after approximately 4,782 Martian years, assuming fixed duration of Mars northward equinox year. But as the Martian year length is known to drift (+0.00079 sols per 1,000 Martian years [1, p3]), more accurate error expression that includes annual duration drift can be expressed as following:

$$
Accumulated\ Error(sols) = \int_0^t \left(\frac{668 \times 10 + 669 \times 11 + 670}{22} - (668.5907 + 0.00079t/1000)\right) dt
$$

Solving for t, error expression becomes $2.1 \times 10^{-4}ùë° - 3.95 \times 10^{-7}ùë°^2$, so 1 sol error will accumulate in 1878 Martian years (approximately 3532 Earth ones), illustrated below:

### EPOCH
The epoch date and time is provisionally set to Mars vernal equinox of April 11, 1955, at UTC 19:21:51 to keep the calendar aligned with planetary seasons and in sync with MST (Mean Solar Time). Years are counted from 1, and negative years start from -1, as in Gregorian calendar (i.e. there is no year 0).

### EASE OF USE
This concept requires minimal new information to memorize: essentially just the 22-year cycle structure and two month lengths: one constant and one dependent on the year's position within the cycle.

## SOURCE CODE
A simple command-line utility ("exodus.py") is is available that allows conversions between terrestrial (UTC) and Martian (in MTC) dates. Packaged into library that is available on PyPi:
