"""
This module defines a collection of custom exceptions for handling various error scenarios encountered during
interactions with Jira. Each exception class extends the BaseException class and targets specific issues such as
missing configuration variables, errors in setting story epics, listing and editing issues, managing descriptions,
assigning/unassigning issues, voting on story points, and other Jira-related operations. The structured approach
to exception handling allows for clearer error management and debugging in applications that integrate with Jira.
