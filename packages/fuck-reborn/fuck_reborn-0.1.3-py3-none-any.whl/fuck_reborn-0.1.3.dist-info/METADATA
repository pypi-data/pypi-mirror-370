## ⚙️ Configuration

fuck-reborn requires a **Google Gemini API Key**.
You can set it in two ways:

1. **`.env` file** (recommended):
   Create a `.env` file in your home or project directory:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Environment variable**:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

> 🔑 Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).

## 🚀 Usage

Just run `fuck-reborn` after a failed command:
```bash
$ gti status
/bin/sh: gti: command not found
$ fuck-reborn gti status
Gemini suggests: git status
Run it? (y/n): y
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **1. Missing API Key**
- **Error**: `GEMINI_API_KEY not found`
- **Fix**: Ensure the key is set in `.env` or exported in your shell.

### **2. Command Not Found**
- **Error**: `fuck-reborn: command not found`
- **Fix**: Ensure the package is installed and your `PATH` includes the Python `bin` directory.

### **3. PyPI Version Issues**
- **Error**: `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement`
- **Fix**: Upgrade pip and try again:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install fuck-reborn
  ```
