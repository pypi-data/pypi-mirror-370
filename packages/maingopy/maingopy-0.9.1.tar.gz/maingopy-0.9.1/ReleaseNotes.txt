Release version 0.3.0 (June 12th, 2020):
	- New features:
		- MAiNGO now uses the toolkit MeLOn - Machine Learning Models for Optimization

			- The models from MeLOn can now be used when writing problems for the C++-API of MAiNGO
			- These models use some custom relaxations available in MAiNGO through MC++ for faster convergence
			- In order to use MeLOn within MAiNGO, the Cmake flag MAiNGO_build_melon needs to be set to true (default)
			- Note that MeLOn is not compatible with current Intel Compilers due to missing C++17 features
	- MAiNGO algorithm:
		- The parser now preserves the order of variable declaration and does not eliminate variables that do not occur in the problem
		- Added new intrinsic functions (for more details, see doc/implementedFunctions/Implemented_functions.pdf):

				- Lower confidence bound
				- Expected improvement
				- Probability of improvement
	- Examples & documentation:
		- Examples were added for the use of the models from MeLOn:
			- An example for problems with artificial neural networks embedded
			- An example for problems with Gaussian processes embedded (e.g., minimizing the prediction or variance of a Gaussian process)
			- An example for using MAiNGO within Bayesian optimization (i.e., maximizing/minimizing typical acquisition functions for Bayesian optimization that use Gaussian processes)
		- The documentation for building MAiNGO was improved
		- A section on the output written by MAiNGO was added
	- Third-party libraries:
		- Included MeLOn (see above)
		- Upgraded to new MUMPS version 5.3.1.
