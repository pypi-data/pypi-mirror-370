The basic interval arithmetic library is from NVIDIA, see: Collange, S., Daumas, M., and Defour, D. “Interval arithmetic in CUDA”. In:
GPU Computing Gems Jade Edition. Elsevier, 2012, pp. 99–107.

The other arithmetic operations and intrinsic functions in CUDA_math.h are implemented by Tim Kerkenhoff.
