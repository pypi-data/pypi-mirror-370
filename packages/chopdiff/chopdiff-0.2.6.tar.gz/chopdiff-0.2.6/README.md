# chopdiff

`chopdiff` is a small library of tools I've developed to make it easier to do fairly
complex transformations of text documents, especially for LLM applications, where you
want to manipulate text, Markdown, and HTML documents in a clean way.

Basically, it lets you parse, diff, and transform text at the level of words, sentences,
paragraphs, and "chunks" (paragraphs grouped in an HTML tag like a `<div>`). It aims to
have minimal dependencies.

Example use cases:

- **Filter diffs:** Diff two documents and only accept changes that fit a specific
  filter. For example, you can ask an LLM to edit a transcript, only inserting paragraph
  breaks but enforcing that the LLM can't do anything except insert whitespace.
  Or let it only edit punctuation, whitespace, and lemma variants of words.
  Or only change one word at a time (e.g. for spell checking).

- **Backfill information:** Match edited text against a previous version of a document
  (using a word-level LCS diff), then pull information from one doc to another.
  For example, say you have a timestamped transcript and an edited summary.
  You can then backfill timestamps of each paragraph into the edited text.

- **Windowed transforms:** Walk through a large document N paragraphs, N sentences, or N
  tokens at a time, processing the results with an LLM call, then "stitching together"
  the results, even if the chunks overlap.

## Installation

Drop the `extras` if you don't want the dependency on `simplemma` (it's about 70MB).

Full deps:

```shell
# Using uv (recommended)
uv add chopdiff[extras]
# Using poetry
poetry add chopdiff -E extras
# Using pip
pip install chopdiff[extras]
```

Basic deps:

```shell
# Using uv (recommended)
uv add chopdiff
# Using poetry
poetry add chopdiff
# Using pip
pip install chopdiff
```

## Comparison to Alternatives

There are full-blown Markdown and HTML parsing libs (such as
[Marko](https://github.com/frostming/marko) and
[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)) but these tend
to focus specifically on fully parsing documents as parse trees.
On the other end of the spectrum, there are NLP libraries (like
[spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy)) that do more expensive, full language
parsing and sentence segmentation.

This is a lightweight alternative to those approaches when you are just focusing on
processing text, don't want a big dependency (like a full XML parser or NLP toolkit) and
also want full control over the original source format (since the original text is
exactly preserved, even whitespace—every sentence, paragraph, and token is mapped back
to the original text).

Note you may wish to also use this in conjunction with a Markdown parser or
auto-formatter, as it can make documents and diffs more readable.
You may wish to use [**flowmark**](https://github.com/jlevy/flowmark) for this alongside
chopdiff.

## Overview

More on what's here:

- The [`TextDoc`](src/chopdiff/docs/text_doc.py) class allows parsing of documents into
  sentences and paragraphs.
  By default, this uses only regex heuristics for speed and simplicity, but optionally
  you can use a sentence splitter of your choice, like Spacy.

- Tokenization using ["wordtoks"](src/chopdiff/docs/wordtoks.py) that lets you measure
  size and extract subdocs via arbitrary units of paragraphs, sentences, words, chars,
  or tokens, with mappings between each, e.g. mapping sentence 3 of paragraph 2 to its
  corresponding character or token offset.
  The tokenization is simple but flexible, including whitespace (sentence or paragraph
  breaks) and HTML tags as single tokens.
  It also maintains exact offsets of each token in the original document text.

- [Word-level diffs](src/chopdiff/docs/token_diffs.py) that don't work at the line level
  (like usual git-style diffs) but rather treat whitespace, sentence, and paragraph
  breaks as individual tokens.
  It performs LCS-style token-based diffs with
  [cydifflib](https://github.com/rapidfuzz/cydifflib), which is significantly faster
  than Python's built-in [difflib](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/difflib.html).

- [Filtering](src/chopdiff/transforms/diff_filters.py) of these text-based diffs based
  on specific criteria.
  For example, only adding or removing words, only changing whitespace, only changing
  word lemmas, etc.

- The [`TokenMapping`](src/chopdiff/docs/token_mapping.py) class offers word-based
  mappings between docs, allowing you to find what part of a doc corresponds with
  another doc as a token index mappings.

- [`search_tokens`](src/chopdiff/docs/search_tokens.py) gives simple way to search back
  and forth among the tokens of a document.
  That is, you can seek forward or backward to any desired token (HTML tag, word,
  punctuation, or sentence or paragraph break matching a predicate) from any given
  position.

- Lightweight "chunking" of documents by wrapping paragraphs in `<div>`s to indicate
  chunks. [`TextNode`](src/chopdiff/divs/text_node.py) offers simple recursive parsing
  around `<div>` tags.
  This is not a general HTML parser, but rather a way to chunk documents into named
  pieces. Unlike more complex parsers, the `TextNode` parser operates on character
  offsets, so maintains the original document exactly and allows exact reassembly if
  desired.

- The word-based token mapping allows
  [transformation](src/chopdiff/transforms/sliding_transforms.py) of documents via
  sliding windows, transforming text (e.g. via an LLM call one window at a time, with
  overlapping windows), then re-stitching the results back together with best
  alignments.

All this is done very simply in memory, and with only regex or basic Markdown parsing to
keep things simple and with few dependencies.

`chopdiff` has no heavier dependencies like full XML or BeautifulSoup parsing or Spacy
or nltk for sentence splitting (though you can use these as custom sentence parsers if
you like).

## Examples

Here are a couple examples to illustrate how all this works, with verbose logging to see
the output. See the [examples/](examples/) directory.

### Inserting Paragraph Breaks

This is an example of diff filtering (see
[insert_para_breaks.py](examples/insert_para_breaks.py) for full code):

```python
import argparse
import logging
from textwrap import dedent

import openai
from flowmark import fill_text

from chopdiff.docs import TextDoc
from chopdiff.transforms import changes_whitespace, filtered_transform, WINDOW_2K_WORDTOKS

def llm_insert_para_breaks(input_text: str) -> str:
    """
    Call OpenAI to insert paragraph breaks on a chunk of text.
    Note there is no guarantee this might not make other
    non-whitespace changes.
    """
    client = openai.OpenAI()

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a careful and precise editor."},
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": dedent(
                    f"""
                    Break the following text into paragraphs.

                    Original text:

                    {input_text}

                    Formatted text:
                    """
                ),
            },
        ],
        temperature=0.0,
    )

    return response.choices[0].message.content or ""


def insert_paragraph_breaks(text: str) -> str:
    # Create a TextDoc from the input text
    doc = TextDoc.from_text(text)
    print(f"Input document: {doc.size_summary()}")

    # Define the transformation function.
    # Note in this case we run the LLM on strings, but you could also work directly
    # on the TextDoc if appropriate.
    def transform(doc: TextDoc) -> TextDoc:
        return TextDoc.from_text(llm_insert_para_breaks(doc.reassemble()))

    # Apply the transformation with windowing and filtering.
    #
    # This will walk along the document in approximately 2K "wordtok" chunks
    # (~1000 words) and apply the transformation to each chunk. Chunks can
    # slightly overlap to make this more robust.
    #
    # The change on each chunk will then be filtered to only include whitespace
    # changes.
    #
    # Finally each change will be "stitched back" to form the original document,
    # by looking for the right alignment of words between the original and the
    # transformed chunk.
    #
    # (Turn on logging to see these details.)
    result_doc = filtered_transform(
        doc, transform, windowing=WINDOW_2K_WORDTOKS, diff_filter=changes_whitespace
    )

    print(f"Output document: {result_doc.size_summary()}")

    # Return the transformed text
    return result_doc.reassemble()
```

Running this shows how it works.
Note GPT-4o-mini makes a typo correction, even though it wasn't requested.
But the diff filter enforces that the output exactly contains only paragraph breaks:

```
$ uv run examples/insert_para_breaks.py examples/gettysberg.txt 

--- Original --------------------------------------------------------------

four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new
nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created
equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any
nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great
battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final
resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is
altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not
dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and
dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or
detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can
never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here
to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is
rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these

measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in
vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government
of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

### Backfilling Timestamps

Here is an example of backfilling data from one text file to another similar but not
identical text file (see [backfill_timestamps.py](examples/backfill_timestamps.py) for
code). As you can see, the text is aligned by mapping the words and then the timestamps
inserted at the end of each paragraph based on the first sentence of each paragraph:

```
$ uv run examples/backfill_timestamps.py
