        Chunk size is the main unit of streaming - all signal samples within
        a single chunk are computed, stored in memory, and transferred to the
        hardware in one operation together, at the same time as the previous
        chunk is playing.

        Optimal chunk size depends on the tradeoff. Larger size reduces the
        risk of buffer underflow at the cost of increased overhead - memory
        allocation and the initial chunk compute will take longer.
        The default value is 150 ms.

        Notes:
            If chunk size exceeds the total sequence duration, no streaming
            actually happens - all samples are computed before generation
            starts. This could be used to eliminate the risk of underflows
            if sequence is sufficiently short. However, in-stream looping

            * ``None`` - no card exports

        Notes:
            (1) NIStreamer uses *run-based static* reference clock export -
            signal is statically exported during ``init_stream()`` and then
            automatically undone during ``close_stream()`` calls.

            This export is *static* instead of being tied to NI tasks.
            As a result, any card supporting 10MHz export can serve as the
            provider. It does not have to be active (get some instructions)
            or even be registered in the streamer.

            (2) If this mechanism is not sufficient, you can manually do a static
            export from any card by calling :meth:`~nistreamer.utils.share_10mhz_ref()`.
            However, such export will not be undone automatically - you should
            manually call :meth:`~nistreamer.utils.unshare_10mhz_ref()` or
            :meth:`~nistreamer.utils.reset_dev()`.

            Forgetting to undo manual export is very easy and dangerous -
            the exporter card will continue silently feeding the signal until
            the system is power-cycled. That can lead to physical
            double-driving and very confusing mis-triggering or mis-clocking
            errors. So only choose the manual export over the automatic method

                This value DOES NOT show the current play position and cannot serve

                Samples are computed and written to cards before they are actually played.
                So this value - the number of fully *written* repetitions - can be greater

                significantly, especially for very short sequences.

                Instead, this value is meant to be a coarse progress indicator for
                long-running in-stream loops (see example below).
