## � Advanced Usage

### Complete Workflow Example

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from xai_easy import explain_model, explain_instance, save_html_report

# 1. Prepare your data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, random_state=42)
feature_names = [f"feature_{i+1}" for i in range(X.shape[1])]
X_df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=feature_names)

# 2. Train your model  
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_df, y)

# 3. Generate global explanations
global_explanations = explain_model(
    model, X_df, y, 
    task="classification", 
    top_n=10
)

# 4. Generate local explanations
local_explanations = explain_instance(
    model, X_df, 
    X_df.iloc[0],  # Explain first instance
    feature_names=feature_names
)

# 5. Create professional HTML report
save_html_report(
    global_explanations, 
    local_explanations,
    title="Professional ML Model Analysis Report",
    filename="model_analysis.html"
)
```
