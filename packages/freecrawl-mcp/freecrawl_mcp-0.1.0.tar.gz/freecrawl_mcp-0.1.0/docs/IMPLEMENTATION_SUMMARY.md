## ✅ Testing Results

### **Automated Tests**
```bash
$ uv run /Users/dylan/Workspace/mcp/servers/freecrawl/freecrawl.py --test
✓ Browser installation successful
✓ Basic scraping test passed
✓ Health check test passed  
✓ All tests passed - FreeCrawl is working correctly
```

### **Example Usage**
```bash
$ uv run mcp/example_usage.py
✓ Successfully scraped content (3597 chars)

## 🔄 Integration Ready

### **Claude Code MCP Setup**
The server is ready for immediate integration with Claude Code:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freecrawl": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "/Users/dylan/Workspace/mcp/servers/freecrawl/freecrawl.py"],
      "cwd": "/Users/dylan/Workspace/claude/agent-workflows/dev"
    }
  }
}
```

### **Usage Examples**
- Web content extraction for research and analysis
- Batch processing of multiple URLs for data collection
- Document processing for PDF and text file analysis
- Health monitoring for operational oversight

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met
