   → Set file_complete=true, increment current_file_index

2. If pattern_complete=false:
   → Route to patterndetectionagent

3. If pattern_complete=true and vulnerabilities found and context_complete=false:
   → Route to contextanalysisagent

4. If vulnerabilities found and compliance_complete=false:
   → Route to complianceagent

5. If current file analysis done (pattern_complete=true):
   → Set file_complete=true, increment current_file_index

6. If current_file_index >= total files:

PATTERN_DETECTION_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["state"],
    template="""
You are a Pattern Detection Security Agent. Your job is to scan code for security vulnerabilities using pattern matching.

CURRENT STATE:
{state}

YOUR TASK:
Analyze the file_content for security vulnerabilities using pattern matching. Look for:

CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES:

1. SQL INJECTION:
- f-strings with SQL: f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {{user_id}}"
- .format() with SQL: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {{}}".format(user_id)
- String concatenation: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + user_id
- Direct interpolation in queries without parameterization

2. COMMAND INJECTION:
- os.system() with user input
- subprocess.call/run/Popen with shell=True and user input
- eval() or exec() with user input
- Direct command string building

3. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):
- innerHTML with user input
- document.write() with user input
- dangerouslySetInnerHTML in React
- Unescaped template variables: {{{{user_input|safe}}}}
- Direct HTML string building

4. PATH TRAVERSAL:
- open() with user-controlled paths
- File operations with ../ patterns
- os.path.join with user input without validation

5. HARDCODED SECRETS:
- password = "literal_string"
- api_key = "literal_string" 
- AWS_SECRET_KEY = "literal_string"
- private_key = "literal_string"
- Any hardcoded credentials

6. WEAK CRYPTOGRAPHY:
- MD5 or SHA1 for passwords
- DES, RC4 encryption
- Random() for security tokens (not cryptographically secure)
- Weak key generation

7. XXE (XML External Entity):
- XML parsing with resolve_entities=True
- Unsafe XML parsers without entity resolution disabled

8. INSECURE DESERIALIZATION:
- pickle.loads() with user input
- yaml.load() without safe loader
- eval() on JSON-like strings

9. SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):
- requests.get() with user-controlled URLs
- urllib with user input
- No URL validation before making requests

10. LDAP INJECTION:
- LDAP queries with string concatenation
- Unescaped special characters in LDAP filters

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. Scan line by line for vulnerability patterns
2. Consider the context (is user input involved?)
3. Check if sanitization/validation is present
4. Assess severity based on exploitability
5. Avoid false positives (check if input is actually user-controlled)

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Return ONLY valid JSON with vulnerability findings:

  "file_path": "same as input",
  "file_content": "same as input",
  "language": "same as input",
  "framework": "same as input",
  "vulnerabilities": [

IMPORTANT:
- Return ONLY the JSON, no other text
- Include line numbers for each vulnerability
- Be specific about the vulnerability type
- Consider false positives (e.g., commented code, test files)
- Set pattern_complete to true when done
- Keep all other state fields unchanged

CONTEXT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["state"],
    template="""
You are a Context Analysis Security Agent. Your job is to perform deep code analysis to find complex security vulnerabilities that require understanding code context, data flow, and business logic.

CURRENT STATE:
{state}

PATTERN DETECTION ALREADY FOUND:
(See current state above for existing vulnerabilities)

YOUR TASK:
Perform deep contextual analysis to find vulnerabilities that simple pattern matching might miss:

COMPLEX VULNERABILITIES TO DETECT:

1. BUSINESS LOGIC FLAWS:
- Authentication bypass possibilities
- Authorization issues (privilege escalation)
- Race conditions in critical operations
- Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) bugs
- Incorrect state management

2. DATA FLOW VULNERABILITIES:
- Trace user input from entry point to dangerous sinks
- Identify if validation/sanitization is properly applied
- Check if data transformations introduce vulnerabilities
- Find second-order injection (stored XSS, stored SQLi)

3. AUTHENTICATION & SESSION ISSUES:
- Weak session management
- Missing authentication on sensitive endpoints
- Insecure password reset flows
- JWT implementation flaws
- OAuth/SAML misconfigurations

4. CRYPTOGRAPHIC ISSUES:
- Improper use of encryption (ECB mode, weak IVs)
- Timing attacks in comparisons
- Insufficient randomness in token generation
- Key management problems
- Password storage issues beyond weak hashing

5. API SECURITY:
- Missing rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- GraphQL specific vulnerabilities (nested queries, introspection)
- REST API authorization flaws
- Excessive data exposure in responses
- CORS misconfigurations

6. FRAMEWORK-SPECIFIC VULNERABILITIES:
Django:
- Missing CSRF protection
- Debug mode enabled
- Insecure middleware configuration

Flask:
- Secret key hardcoded or weak
- Insecure session configuration
- SSTI vulnerabilities

React/Vue:
- Unsafe use of dangerouslySetInnerHTML/v-html
- State management vulnerabilities
- Client-side authentication logic

Express/Node:
- Prototype pollution
- Insecure middleware order
- Missing security headers

7. ADVANCED INJECTION CONTEXTS:
- NoSQL injection
- GraphQL injection
- Template injection (SSTI)
- Header injection
- Log injection
- Email header injection

8. FILE HANDLING ISSUES:
- Unrestricted file upload
- Missing file type validation
- Directory traversal in archives (zip slip)
- Symbolic link following

9. CONCURRENCY ISSUES:
- Race conditions in financial transactions
- Double-spending vulnerabilities
- Deadlocks in critical paths

10. INFORMATION DISCLOSURE:
- Sensitive data in error messages
- Debug information leakage
- Version disclosure
- Internal paths/structure exposure
- Timing attacks revealing information

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. Understand the overall code flow and architecture
2. Identify entry points for user input
3. Trace data flow from input to output/storage
4. Analyze authentication and authorization logic
5. Check for proper error handling
6. Look for assumptions that could be violated
7. Consider the framework/library context
8. Identify missing security controls

IMPORTANT CONTEXT CONSIDERATIONS:
- Is this production code or test code?
- What framework patterns are being used?
- Are there compensating controls elsewhere?
- What is the threat model for this application?
- Are there any custom security implementations?

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Return ONLY valid JSON with NEW vulnerabilities found through context analysis:
