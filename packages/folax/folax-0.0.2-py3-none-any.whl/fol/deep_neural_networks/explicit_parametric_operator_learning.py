class ExplicitParametricOperatorLearning(DeepNetwork):
    """
    A class for explicit parametric operator learning in deep neural networks.

    This class extends the `DeepNetwork` base class and is designed specifically 
    for learning parametric operators where spatial fields like predicted displacement
    are explicitly modeled. It inherits all the attributes and methods from `DeepNetwork` and introduces 
    additional components to handle control parameters.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name assigned to the neural network model for identification purposes.
        control (Control): An instance of the Control class used for the parametric learning.
        loss_function (Loss): An instance of the Loss class representing the objective function to be minimized during training.
        flax_neural_network (Module): The Flax neural network model (inherited from flax.nnx.Module) that defines the architecture and forward pass of the network.
        optax_optimizer (GradientTransformation): The Optax optimizer used to compute and apply gradients during the training process.
        checkpoint_settings (dict): A dictionary of configurations used to manage checkpoints, saving model states and parameters during or after training. Defaults to an empty dictionary.

        Initialize the explicit parametric operator learning model, its components, and control parameters.

        This method extends the initialization process defined in the `DeepNetwork` base class by
        ensuring that the control parameters used for parametric learning are also initialized.
        It handles both the initialization of core deep learning components (loss function, 
        checkpoint settings, neural network state restoration) and the initialization of 
        the control parameters essential for explicit parametric learning tasks.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        reinitialize : bool, optional
            If True, forces reinitialization of the model and its components, including control parameters,
