# Adopt floor-and-cap for teams that want a safety ceiling:
# >= installed, < next major (SemVer guardrail).
path = "requirements.txt"
policy = "floor-and-cap"

# Teams often allow pre-releases only for a few packages; default is off.

# You can still pass per-package policies via CLI flags (patterns) if needed.
# This file keeps it simple; see docs/CONFIG.md for advanced overrides.
