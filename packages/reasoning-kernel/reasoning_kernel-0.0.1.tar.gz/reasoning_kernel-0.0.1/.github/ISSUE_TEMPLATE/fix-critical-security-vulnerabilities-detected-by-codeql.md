# Fix Critical Security Vulnerabilities Detected by CodeQL

## Overview
CodeQL has detected multiple high-severity security vulnerabilities in our codebase that require immediate remediation:
- **2 Insecure Randomness vulnerabilities** in frontend HTML files
- **24 Log Injection vulnerabilities** across multiple Python modules

## Vulnerability Details

### Insecure Randomness (2 instances)
These vulnerabilities can lead to predictable random values being used for security-sensitive operations.

```yaml
data:

**Affected Files:**
- `app/static/realtime-streaming.html:537`
- `app/static/index.html:1207`

### Log Injection (24 instances)
Log injection vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious content into log files, potentially leading to log forgery, log poisoning, or execution of malicious commands.

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Fix Insecure Randomness
Replace insecure random number generation with cryptographically secure alternatives:
- Use `crypto.getRandomValues()` in JavaScript instead of `Math.random()`
- For tokens/IDs, use UUID v4 or similar secure random generators

### 2. Fix Log Injection
Implement proper input sanitization and structured logging:
- Sanitize all user inputs before logging
- Use structured logging with separate fields for user data
- Implement a secure logging utility function
- Consider using a logging library that automatically handles sanitization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Secure Utilities
Create utility functions for secure operations that will be used throughout the codebase.

### Phase 2: Fix Frontend Vulnerabilities
Update the HTML files to use secure random number generation.

### Phase 3: Fix Backend Log Injection
Systematically update all logging statements in the affected Python files.

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- Run CodeQL scan to verify fixes
- Add unit tests for security utilities
- Perform security review

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - These are high-severity security vulnerabilities that need immediate attention.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All insecure randomness issues resolved
- [ ] All log injection vulnerabilities fixed
- [ ] CodeQL scan passes without these vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security utilities created and documented
- [ ] Unit tests added for security fixes
- [ ] Code reviewed by security team
