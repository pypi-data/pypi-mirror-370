# Core Concepts

This document provides a high-level overview of the core concepts behind the MSA Reasoning Engine.

## 1. The Problem: Bridging the Gap Between Human and Machine Reasoning

Humans are remarkably good at reasoning about the world. We can make sense of new and unfamiliar situations, draw on a vast store of background knowledge, and make coherent judgments in the face of uncertainty. Machines, on the other hand, have traditionally struggled with these tasks.

The MSA Reasoning Engine is designed to bridge this gap. It is a system that can reason about the world in a more human-like way, by combining the strengths of large language models and probabilistic programming.

## 2. The Solution: The Model Synthesis Architecture (MSA)

The core idea behind the MSA Reasoning Engine is the **Model Synthesis Architecture (MSA)**. The MSA is a framework for building AI systems that can reason about the world in a more flexible and robust way.

The MSA is based on the idea that when humans reason about a new situation, they don't rely on a single, pre-existing mental model. Instead, they construct a **bespoke mental model** that is tailored to the specific problem at hand. This process of on-demand model synthesis is what allows us to be so flexible and adaptive in our reasoning.

The MSA implements this idea in a two-part architecture:

1.  **Global Relevance and Synthesis:** This component uses a large language model (LLM) to identify and retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and then synthesize a probabilistic program that represents the situation.

2.  **Coherent World Model:** This component uses a probabilistic programming language (PPL) to execute the synthesized program and perform inference. This allows the system to make coherent judgments and predictions, even in the face of uncertainty.

## 3. The Five-Stage Reasoning Pipeline

The MSA is implemented as a five-stage reasoning pipeline:

1.  **Parse:** The system takes a natural language description of a situation (a "vignette") and parses it to extract key information, such as entities, relationships, and constraints.

2.  **Retrieve:** The system retrieves relevant background knowledge from a knowledge base.

3.  **Graph:** The system constructs a causal dependency graph to model the relationships between the different factors in the situation.

4.  **Synthesize:** The system generates a probabilistic program that represents the causal dependency graph.

5.  **Infer:** The system executes the probabilistic program to perform inference and generate predictions.

## 4. Key Benefits

The MSA Reasoning Engine provides several key benefits over traditional approaches to AI reasoning:

*   **Flexibility:** The system can reason about a wide range of situations, including those that it has never seen before.
*   **Coherence:** The system's reasoning is coherent and consistent, thanks to the use of probabilistic models.
*   **Transparency:** The system's reasoning process is transparent and explainable, thanks to the "thinking mode" feature.
*   **Extensibility:** The system is modular and extensible, making it easy to add new capabilities and integrate it with other systems.
