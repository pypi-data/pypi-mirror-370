## Quick Start

Get started with the Reasoning Kernel in minutes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Installation">
    Install the Reasoning Kernel using pip or uv:
    ```bash
    pip install reasoning-kernel
    # or with uv
    uv add reasoning-kernel
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configuration">
    Set up your environment variables:
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
    export REDIS_URL="redis://your-redis-instance:6379"
    export DAYTONA_WORKSPACE_ID="your-workspace-id"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Basic Usage">
    Create your first reasoning session:
    ```python
    from reasoning_kernel import ReasoningKernel
    
    kernel = ReasoningKernel()
    result = await kernel.reason(
        "A manufacturing plant's assembly line stopped due to sensor malfunction. "
        "500 urgent orders are due in 48 hours. Analyze the situation."
    )
    
    print(f"Analysis: {result.reasoning_result}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence}")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
