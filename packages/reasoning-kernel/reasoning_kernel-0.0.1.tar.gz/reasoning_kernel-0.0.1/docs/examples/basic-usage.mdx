## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Simple Decision Analysis

Let's start with a basic business decision scenario:

        scenario = """

        delivery service. Current facts:

        - Estimated additional revenue: $12,000-18,000/month
        - Competition: 3 other restaurants offer delivery
        - Customer survey: 68% interested in delivery option
        
        Should they expand their delivery service?
        """

        print(f"Recommendation: {result.reasoning_result}")
        print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.2f}")

    # Run the example
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        result = asyncio.run(simple_decision_example())
    ```
    
    **Expected Output:**
    ```
    === Decision Analysis ===
    Recommendation: Expand delivery service. The financial analysis shows 
    positive ROI with break-even at 67% of estimated demand. Customer 
    interest (68%) exceeds break-even threshold, providing safety margin.
    Confidence: 0.84
    
    === Reasoning Steps ===
    1. Calculate net revenue range: $4,000-10,000/month
    2. Assess customer demand vs. required utilization
    3. Evaluate competitive positioning and market share
    4. Consider implementation risks and mitigation strategies

        several critical decisions:
        
        Technical:
        - Technology works at lab scale (99.2% capture efficiency)
        - Scaling to industrial level unproven
        - Energy requirements: 30% less than current tech
        - Patent protection: Strong in US, pending in EU/China

## Best Practices

Based on these examples, here are key best practices for using the Reasoning Kernel:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scenario Design" icon="pencil">
    **Provide Rich Context**: Include relevant facts, constraints, and objectives
    
    **Be Specific**: Quantify information when possible (numbers, percentages, timelines)
    
    **Include Uncertainties**: Mention what's unknown or uncertain
    
    **Set Clear Objectives**: Define what decision or analysis is needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Configuration Choices" icon="cog">
    **Match Config to Use Case**: Use appropriate config for scientific, business, or creative reasoning
    
    **Set Appropriate Thresholds**: Adjust confidence thresholds based on decision importance
    
    **Enable Features Selectively**: Use MSA, exploration, or multi-agent reasoning when beneficial
    
    **Consider Performance**: Balance capability with response time requirements
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Result Interpretation" icon="chart-bar">
    **Check Confidence Scores**: Lower confidence may indicate need for more information
    
    **Review Reasoning Traces**: Understand how conclusions were reached
    
    **Consider Uncertainties**: Factor in confidence intervals and risk assessments
    
    **Validate Assumptions**: Verify that the system's assumptions match reality
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Iterative Improvement" icon="arrow-path">
    **Start Simple**: Begin with basic scenarios before adding complexity
    
    **Refine Incrementally**: Use results to improve scenario descriptions
    
    **Learn from Patterns**: Notice what types of problems work best
    
    **Build on Success**: Use successful reasoning patterns as templates
  </Accordion>
