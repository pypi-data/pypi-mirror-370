## Batch Processing Examples

### Example 17: Multiple Market Analyses

Process multiple market analysis queries in batch:

Create a batch file `market_analysis.json`:

```json
{
  "queries": [
    {
      "id": "market-1",
      "query": "Analyze market trends for electric vehicles in North America",
      "mode": "both"
    },
    {
      "id": "market-2",
      "query": "Evaluate the competitive landscape for renewable energy storage solutions",
      "mode": "knowledge"
    },
    {
      "id": "market-3",
      "query": "Assess investment opportunities in quantum computing startups",
      "mode": "both"
    }
  ]
}
```

Process the batch:

```bash
reasoning-kernel batch process market_analysis.json --output-dir ./market_analysis_results --session-id market-q1-2025
```

### Example 18: Code Review Batch

Process multiple code files for review:

Create a batch file `code_review.json`:

```json
{
  "queries": [
    {
      "id": "code-1",
      "query": "Review authentication.py for security best practices and potential vulnerabilities",
      "mode": "both"
    },
    {
      "id": "code-2",
      "query": "Analyze data_processing.py for performance optimization opportunities",
      "mode": "knowledge"
    },
    {
      "id": "code-3",
      "query": "Evaluate api_endpoints.py for REST API design best practices",
      "mode": "both"
    }
  ]
}
```

Process the batch:

```bash
reasoning-kernel batch process code_review.json --output-dir ./code_review_results --session-id code-review-2025
```

## Advanced Usage Examples

### Example 19: Interactive Session with Context

Start an interactive session for in-depth analysis:

```bash
reasoning-kernel --interactive --session-id strategic-planning-session
```

In interactive mode, you can ask follow-up questions and build on previous responses to develop a comprehensive analysis.

### Example 20: Exporting Results for Reporting

Export session results for presentation:

```bash
# Export to JSON for data processing
reasoning-kernel session export strategic-planning-session --output strategic_plan.json --format json

# Export to Markdown for documentation
reasoning-kernel session export strategic-planning-session --output strategic_plan.md --format md

# Export to PDF for presentation (requires weasyprint)
reasoning-kernel session export strategic-planning-session --output strategic_plan.pdf --format pdf
```

## Tips for Effective Usage

1. **Use Sessions**: For related queries, use sessions to maintain context and organize your work.

2. **Leverage Different Modes**: Use `--mode knowledge` for quick information retrieval and `--mode both` for comprehensive analysis including probabilistic reasoning.

3. **Batch Processing**: For repetitive tasks or multiple related queries, use batch processing to save time.

4. **Export Results**: Export your results in appropriate formats for sharing and further analysis.

5. **Interactive Mode**: Use interactive mode for complex, multi-faceted problems where you need to explore different aspects through dialogue.

6. **Document Analysis**: Use the analyze command for detailed review of documents, code, or other text-based inputs.

These examples demonstrate the versatility of the MSA Reasoning Kernel CLI for various reasoning tasks. Adapt these patterns to your specific needs and explore the full capabilities of the system.
