* Remove unused and incomplete Docker stuff

* Various enhancements to the digital scorecard:

  - when the player tries to start the game before the countdown is started
    she is gently asked to wait until that happens

  - when the Queen gets pocketed, the server is immediately informed so that people watching
    the Lit page of the match will see it

  - the automatic dimming of the device's display can be disabled and re-enabled at will, to
    reduce distracting gestures to resume the session when entering scores

* Users now have an upper limit on the level of ratings they can use/create: the rationale is
  that only an handful of them are expected to run international events, and all the other
  should use local or national ratings

* Rectify and improve handling of the “delay compatriots pairing”: it is now a number of
  rounds, similar to the “delay top players pairing”, instead of a boolean flag (issue `#41`__)
