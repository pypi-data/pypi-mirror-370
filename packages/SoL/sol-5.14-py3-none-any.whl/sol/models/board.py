    This table contains the detailed scores of a single match.

    Since entering such details is very time-consuming, historically and usually only the final
    scores of the match are assigned.

    .. note:: In *normal boards* `coinsX` is the number of carrommen of the opponent competitor
              still on the table at the end of the board; `coins1` and `coins2` are thus
              mutually exclusive (ie, one is zero) and the board is won by the competitor with
              a `coins` number greater than zero, with a score equal to that number plus
              possibly the points of the `queen` if pocketed by him.

              In *training boards* `coins1` and `coins2` are actually the *number of misses* of
              the respective competitors, in other words how many unsuccessful shots they made:
              the meaning is reversed, the board is won by the competitor with the lower
              number. The `queen` field has no meaning.
