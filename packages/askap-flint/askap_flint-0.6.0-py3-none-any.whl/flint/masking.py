    Internally should a signal image be needed it is computed as something akin to:

    This is done in a staged manner to minimise the number of (potentially large) images
    held in memory.

    Each of the input images needs to share the same shape. This means that compression
    features offered by some tooling (e.g. BANE --compress) can not be used.

    Depending on the `MaksingOptions` used the signal image may not be needed.

    Once the signal map as been computed, all pixels below ``min_snr`` are flagged.

    Args:
        fits_image_path (Path): Path to the FITS file containing an image
        masking_options (MaskingOptions): Configurables on the masking operation procedure.
        fits_rms_path (Optional[Path], optional): Path to the FITS file with an RMS image corresponding to ``fits_image_path``. Defaults to None.
