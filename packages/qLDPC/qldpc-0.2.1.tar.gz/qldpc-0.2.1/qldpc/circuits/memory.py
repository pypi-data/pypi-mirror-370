    """Construct a circuit for testing the performance of a code as a quantum memory.

    The circuit consists of (generally multiple) quantum error correction (QEC) cycles for the code,
    using a particular syndrome measurement strategy.  Each QEC cycle measures all parity checks of
    the code, and detectors are added to enforce that (a) the syndrome from the first QEC cycle is
    trivial, and (b) every subsequent QEC cycle yields the same syndrome as the preceding round.
    The "basis" argument determines whether the circuit tracks logical X or Z operators.

    In total, the circuit performs the following:
    1. Initialize all data qubits to |0> (if basis is Pauli.Z) or |+> (if basis is Pauli.X).
    2. Perform an initial QEC cycle, adding detectors for the basis-type stabilizers.
    3. Repeat num_rounds - 1 QEC cycles, adding detectors to enforce that basis-type stabilizers
        have not changed between adjacent QEC cycles.
    4. Measure all data qubits in the specified basis.
    5. Add detectors for basis-type parity checks on the final data qubit measurements.
    6. Use the final data qubit measurements to define all basis-type logical observables.

    Qubits and detectors are assigned coordinates as follows:
    - The data qubit addressed by column c of the parity check matrix gets coordinate (0, c).
    - The check qubit associated with row r of the parity check matrix gets coordinate (1, r).
    - The k-th detector in measurement round m gets coordinate (m, k).

    Args:
        code: An error-correcting code.  If passed a classical code, treat it as a quantum CSS code
            that protects only basis-type logical operators.  Otherwise, only CSS stabilizer
            (non-subsystem) qubit codes are supported at the moment (generalization to non-CSS and
            subsystem codes pending).
        syndrome_measurement_strategy: The syndrome measurement strategy to use, which defines how
            each round of QEC measures all parity checks of the code.  Default: EdgeColoring().
        num_rounds: Total number of QEC cycles to perform.  Must be at least 1.  Default: 1.
        basis: Should be Pauli.X or Pauli.Z, depending the desired logical operators to track.  A
            logical error in a noisy simulation of the circuit corresponds to a logical error in one
            of these operators.  Default: Pauli.X.
        qubit_ids: A QubitIDs object specifying the index of data and check qubits.  Defaults to
            labeling qubits by their corresponding column/row of the parity check matrix.
        noise_model: The noise model to apply to the circuit after construction, or None to return a
            noiseless circuit.  Default: None.

    Returns:
        stim.Circuit: A circuit ready for simulation via Stim or Sinter.
