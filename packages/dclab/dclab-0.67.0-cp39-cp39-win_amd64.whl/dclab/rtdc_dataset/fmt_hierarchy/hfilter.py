        This subclass handles manual filters for hierarchy children.
        The general problem with hierarchy children is that their data
        changes when the hierarchy parent changes. As hierarchy
        children may also have hierarchy children, dealing with
        manual filters (`Filter.manual`) is not trivial. Here,
        the manual filters are translated into event indices of the
        root parent (the highest member of the hierarchy, which is
        `RTDC_Hierarchy.hparent` if there is only one child).
        This enables to keep track of the manually excluded events
        even if

        - the parent changes its filters,
        - the parent is a hierarchy child as well, or
        - the excluded event is filtered out in the parent.

        hidden because a hierarchy parent filtered it out.
