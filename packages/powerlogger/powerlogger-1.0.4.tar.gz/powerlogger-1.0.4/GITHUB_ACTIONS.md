# 🚀 GitHub Actions Workflows for PowerLogger (Windows)

This document explains how to use the automated GitHub Actions workflows for building, testing, and publishing the PowerLogger package on Windows platforms.

## 📋 Available Workflows

### **Simple Test Job Structure**
All workflows include a basic test job that provides quick validation:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

This job runs first and provides immediate feedback on basic functionality.

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### **PyPI API Token**
To enable automatic publishing, you need to add your PyPI API token to GitHub Secrets:

1. **Get PyPI API Token**:
   - Go to [PyPI Account Settings](https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/)
   - Create new API token with scope "Entire account (all projects)"
   - Copy the token (starts with `pypi-`)

2. **Add to GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
   - Click **New repository secret**
   - Name: `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your PyPI API token

### **Repository Settings**
Ensure your repository has:
- **Actions enabled** (Settings → Actions → General)
- **Branch protection** for main branch (recommended)
- **Required status checks** for workflows (optional)

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Automatic Publishing (Recommended)**

1. **Create a GitHub Release**:
   ```bash
   # Tag your release
   git tag v1.0.4
   git push origin v1.0.4
   
   # Create release on GitHub
   # Go to: https://github.com/Pandiyarajk/powerlogger/releases
   # Click "Create a new release"
   # Select the tag and publish
   ```

2. **Workflow Automatically Runs**:
   - Builds package for latest Python versions (3.11-3.13) on Windows
   - Runs comprehensive Windows-specific tests
   - Publishes to PyPI
   - Tests installation from PyPI on Windows
   - Provides Windows-optimized build summaries

### **Manual Publishing**

1. **Go to Actions Tab**:
   - Navigate to your repository's Actions tab
   - Select "🚀 Publish PowerLogger to PyPI"

2. **Run Workflow**:
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Select branch (usually main)
   - Enter version number
   - Choose dry run or full publish
   - Click "Run workflow"

### **Testing Only**

1. **Push to Main/Develop**:
   - Any push triggers automatic Windows testing
   - Tests run on Windows platform only
   - Windows-specific quality checks performed

2. **Pull Request**:
   - Tests run automatically on Windows
   - Ensures Windows compatibility before merge

## 🛠️ Customization

### **Modify Python Versions**
Edit the workflow files to change supported Python versions on Windows:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ["3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
```

### **Windows-Specific Customization**
Add new Windows-specific test configurations:
```yaml
# Test different Windows versions
runs-on: [windows-latest, windows-2022, windows-2019]
```

### **Custom Windows Test Commands**
Modify test steps to run additional Windows-specific checks:
```yaml
- name: 🧪 Custom Windows Tests
  shell: powershell
  run: |
    python -m pytest tests/ -v -m "windows"
    python -m pytest tests/ -v -m "file_handling"
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **PyPI Authentication Failed**:
   - Check `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret is set correctly
   - Verify token has proper scope
   - Ensure token hasn't expired

2. **Tests Failing**:
   - Check test logs for specific errors
   - Verify dependencies are correct
   - Check for platform-specific issues

3. **Build Failures**:
   - Review build logs
   - Check package configuration
   - Verify all required files are present

### **Debug Mode**
Enable debug logging by adding to workflow:
```yaml
env:
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
  ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
```

## 📈 Best Practices

### **Release Management**
1. **Use Semantic Versioning**: v1.0.0, v1.0.1, v1.1.0
2. **Create Release Notes**: Document changes clearly
3. **Test Before Release**: Use dry run mode first on Windows
4. **Monitor Deployment**: Check PyPI after publishing

### **Code Quality**
1. **Run Tests Locally**: Before pushing (on Windows)
2. **Check Formatting**: Use Black and isort
3. **Lint Code**: Run flake8 and mypy
4. **Security Scan**: Regular dependency checks
5. **Windows Compatibility**: Test file handling and encoding

### **Workflow Maintenance**
1. **Update Dependencies**: Keep actions up to date
2. **Monitor Performance**: Optimize slow workflows
3. **Review Logs**: Regular workflow health checks
4. **Backup Secrets**: Store credentials securely
