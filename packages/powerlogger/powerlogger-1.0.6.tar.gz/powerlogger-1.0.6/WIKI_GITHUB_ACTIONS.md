   - Tests installation from PyPI on Windows
   - Provides Windows-optimized build summaries

### **Manual Publishing**

1. **Go to Actions Tab**:
   - Navigate to your repository's Actions tab
   - Select "🚀 Publish PowerLogger to PyPI"

2. **Run Workflow**:
   - Click "Run workflow"

## 🔧 **Setup Requirements**

### **PyPI API Token**

To enable automatic publishing, you need to add your PyPI API token to GitHub Secrets:

1. **Get PyPI API Token**:
   - Go to [PyPI Account Settings](https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/)
   - Create new API token with scope "Entire account (all projects)"
   - Copy the token (starts with `pypi-`)

2. **Add to GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
   - Click **New repository secret**
   - Name: `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your PyPI API token

### **Repository Settings**

Ensure your repository has:
- **Actions enabled** (Settings → Actions → General)
- **Branch protection** for main branch (recommended)
- **Required status checks** for workflows (optional)

  matrix:
    python-version: ["3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
```

### **Windows-Specific Customization**

Add new Windows-specific test configurations:

```yaml
# Test different Windows versions
runs-on: [windows-latest, windows-2022, windows-2019]
```

### **Custom Windows Test Commands**

Modify test steps to run additional Windows-specific checks:

```yaml
- name: 🧪 Custom Windows Tests
  shell: powershell
  run: |
    python -m pytest tests/ -v -m "windows"
    python -m pytest tests/ -v -m "file_handling"
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **PyPI Authentication Failed**:
   - Check `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret is set correctly
   - Verify token has proper scope
   - Ensure token hasn't expired

2. **Tests Failing**:
   - Check test logs for specific errors
   - Verify dependencies are correct
   - Check for platform-specific issues

3. **Build Failures**:
   - Review build logs
   - Check package configuration
   - Verify all required files are present

### **Debug Mode**

Enable debug logging by adding to workflow:

```yaml
env:
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
  ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
```

## 📈 **Best Practices**

### **Release Management**

1. **Use Semantic Versioning**: v1.0.0, v1.0.1, v1.1.0
2. **Create Release Notes**: Document changes clearly
3. **Test Before Release**: Use dry run mode first on Windows
4. **Monitor Deployment**: Check PyPI after publishing

### **Code Quality**

1. **Run Tests Locally**: Before pushing (on Windows)
2. **Check Formatting**: Use Black and isort
3. **Lint Code**: Run flake8 and mypy
4. **Security Scan**: Regular dependency checks
5. **Windows Compatibility**: Test file handling and encoding

### **Workflow Maintenance**

1. **Update Dependencies**: Keep actions up to date
2. **Monitor Performance**: Optimize slow workflows
3. **Review Logs**: Regular workflow health checks
4. **Backup Secrets**: Store credentials securely
