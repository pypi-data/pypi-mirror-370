# Machc Configurator Commons Library

The MachC.Configurator Commons Library provides a robust and extensible foundation for managing application configurations across diverse environments and provisioning methods. It simplifies how developers retrieve and handle configurations, enabling dynamic, scalable, and maintainable solutions that align with evolving business and operational needs.

This library ensures that configuration management remains **flexible**, **modular**, and **use-case agnostic**, serving as a critical component for any application requiring seamless access to runtime settings, static properties, or dynamically-generated values.
