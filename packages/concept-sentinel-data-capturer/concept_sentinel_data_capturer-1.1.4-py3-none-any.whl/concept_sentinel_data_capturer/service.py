[Input]: "The longest river in India is the Ganges (Ganga), if we consider the entire length of the river system within India, including its tributary, the Bhagirathi-Hooghly, which flows for about 2,525 kilometers (1,569 miles). However, the Godavari is the longest river flowing entirely within Indian territory, measuring about 1,465 kilometers (910 miles) long. The Indus River has a greater total length, approximately 3,180 km (1,976 mi), but much of it flows outside India, through Pakistan. The Brahmaputra is longer than the Ganges within India, but it also flows through other countries, including China and Bangladesh."

[Input]: "Infosys was co-founded by Narayana Murthy along with six other engineers: Nandan Nilekani, S. Gopalakrishnan (Kris), S. D. Shibulal, K. Dinesh, N. S. Raghavan, and Ashok Arora. Established in 1981, Infosys started with a modest capital of $250 and has since grown into one of the largest IT services companies in the world. Narayana Murthy, often regarded as the face of Infosys, played a pivotal role in shaping the company's culture and vision, while the combined efforts of all co-founders contributed to its remarkable growth and success in the global IT industry."

            You are a detail-oriented LLM with expertise in extracting main context from a given input prompt. Your task is to extract the main context from the given input prompt.
    
        INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. Carefully read the input (inputPrompt or llmResponse) and identify the main context or key answer.
        2. Extract ONLY the essential topic, subject, or key answer – names, dates, numbers, or direct information that addresses the main query be it response or prompt.
        3. The extracted information should be **extremely concise** and represent only the central subject matter, without any unnecessary details.
        4. Remove all explanatory text, qualifiers, and peripheral information.
        5. For questions, identify only the core subject being asked about. For responses, extract the most relevant and significant answer.
        6. **Only extract one key answer**. If there are multiple possible answers, select **the most relevant and significant one**. Avoid returning multiple answers or lists.
        7. If the answer is a city name with additional context, such as "Bangalore (Bengaluru)", return **only the name of the city** (e.g., "Bangalore" and **not** "Bangalore (Bengaluru)").
        8. The main focus should be on the name, city, entity.
        10. The output should NOT have articles (a, an, the), common connector words (of, about, from, with, etc.), or punctuation except spaces or (-).
        11. Keep only essential nouns and modifiers, and prefer single words or 2-3 word phrases when possible.
        12. Ensure the extracted information is as KEY ANSWER FOR QUERY and is a direct, clear answer with no surrounding text.
        13. Return **only** the output in JSON format with no additional text. Do not include anything else in your response.
