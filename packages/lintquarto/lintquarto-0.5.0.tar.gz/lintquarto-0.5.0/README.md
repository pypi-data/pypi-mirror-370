## Installation

You can install **lintquarto** with pip ([from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lintquarto/)) or conda ([from conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lintquarto)).

### Install with pip

```
pip install lintquarto
```

To include your selection of linters, install them as needed.

For a one-step installation that includes lintquarto and all supported linters and type checkers, use:

```
pip install lintquarto[all]
```

### Install with conda

```
conda install conda-forge::lintquarto
```

With conda, only the main lintquarto tool is installed. If you want to use any linters or type checkers, you must install them separately (either with conda or pip, depending on availability).

## Getting started using `lintquarto`

### Usage

**lintquarto -l LINTER [LINTER ...] -p PATH [PATH ...] [-e EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]] [-k]**

* **-l --linters** LINTER [LINTER ...] - Linters to run.
* **-p --paths** PATH [PATH ...]- Quarto files and/or directories to lint.
* **-e --exclude** EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...] - Files and/or directories to exclude from linting.
* **-k, --keep-temp** - Keep the temporary `.py` files created during linting (for debugging).

Passing extra arguments directly to linters is not supported. Only `.qmd` files are processed.

### Examples

The linter used is interchangeable in these examples.

Lint all `.qmd` files in the current directory (using `pylint`):

```{.bash}
lintquarto -l pylint -p .
```

Lint several specific files (using `pylint` and `flake8`):

```{.bash}
lintquarto -l pylint flake8 -p file1.qmd file2.qmd
```

Keep temporary `.py` files after linting (with `pylint`)

```{.bash}
lintquarto -l pylint -p . -k
```

Lint all files in current directory (using `ruff`):

* Excluding folders `examples/` and `ignore/`, or-
* Excluding a specific file `analysis/test.qmd`.

```{.bash}
lintquarto -l ruff -p . -e examples,ignore
```

```{.bash}
lintquarto -l ruff -p . -e analysis/test.qmd
```
