## Getting Started Right

### Foundation Principles

**Start Simple, Scale Intelligently:**
```bash
# Week 1: Master these essential commands
/sc:brainstorm "vague project idea"      # Requirements discovery
/sc:analyze existing-code/               # Code understanding  
/sc:implement "specific feature"         # Feature development
/sc:test --coverage                      # Quality validation

# Week 2-3: Add coordination
/sc:workflow "complex feature"           # Planning workflows
/sc:improve . --focus quality            # Code improvement
/sc:document . --scope project           # Documentation

# Week 4+: Master optimization
/sc:analyze . --ultrathink --all-mcp     # Advanced analysis
/sc:spawn "enterprise project" --orchestrate  # Complex coordination
```

### Progressive Learning Path

**Phase 1: Command Fundamentals (Days 1-7)**
```bash
# Daily practice routine
Day 1: /sc:brainstorm "daily coding challenge"
Day 2: /sc:analyze sample-project/ --focus quality
Day 3: /sc:implement "simple CRUD API"
Day 4: /sc:test --type unit --coverage
Day 5: /sc:improve previous-work/ --safe-mode
Day 6: /sc:document your-project/ --scope project
Day 7: /sc:workflow "week 2 learning plan"

# Success metrics: Comfort with basic commands, understanding of output
```

**Phase 2: Intelligent Coordination (Days 8-21)**
```bash
# Multi-agent workflow practice
/sc:implement "secure user authentication with testing and documentation"
# Should activate: security-engineer + backend-architect + quality-engineer + technical-writer

# Mode optimization practice
/sc:brainstorm "complex project requirements"  # Brainstorming mode
/sc:spawn "multi-service architecture"         # Task management mode
/sc:analyze performance-issues/ --introspect   # Introspection mode

# Success metrics: Multi-agent coordination understanding, mode awareness
```

**Phase 3: Session and Persistence (Days 22-30)**
```bash
# Long-term project simulation
/sc:load new-project/ --scope project
/sc:save "project-baseline"

# Daily development cycle
/sc:load "project-baseline"
/sc:implement "daily feature"
/sc:test --integration
/sc:save "day-$(date +%m%d)-complete"

# Success metrics: Session management, context preservation, project continuity
```

### Effective Onboarding Patterns

**First Session Optimization:**
```bash
# Optimal first session workflow
/sc:load your-project/                    # Establish project context
/sc:analyze . --scope project             # Understand codebase
/sc:document . --scope project            # Generate project overview
/sc:save "onboarding-complete"           # Save initial understanding

# Expected outcomes:
# - Complete project understanding documented
# - Architecture and quality baseline established  
# - Session context ready for productive development
# - Foundation for all future work sessions
```

**Daily Workflow Establishment:**
```bash
# Proven daily startup routine
/sc:load "current-project"               # Restore context
/sc:reflect "yesterday's progress"       # Review previous work
/sc:workflow "today's objectives"        # Plan daily work
/sc:implement "priority feature"         # Execute development
/sc:test --validate                      # Ensure quality
/sc:save "end-of-day-$(date +%m%d)"    # Preserve progress

# Time investment: 2-3 minutes setup, saves 20+ minutes daily
```

## Command Fundamentals

### Strategic Command Selection

**Command Categories by Purpose:**

**Discovery Commands (Project Understanding):**
```bash
# Use when: Starting new projects, onboarding, architecture review
/sc:load project/ --scope project         # Project understanding
/sc:analyze . --focus architecture        # System design analysis
/sc:brainstorm "project enhancement"       # Requirements discovery
/sc:explain "complex system behavior"     # Concept clarification

# Best practice: Always start projects with discovery commands
# Time investment: 10-15 minutes upfront saves hours later
```

**Development Commands (Active Coding):**
```bash
# Use when: Implementing features, building components, coding
/sc:implement "specific feature with clear requirements"
/sc:design "system component" --type detailed
/sc:build --optimize --target production
/sc:improve code/ --type performance --measure-impact

# Best practice: Be specific in descriptions for better agent activation
# Example: Instead of "add auth", use "implement JWT authentication with rate limiting"
```

**Quality Commands (Validation and Improvement):**
```bash
# Use when: Code review, refactoring, optimization, testing
/sc:test --coverage --validate
/sc:analyze . --focus security --think-hard
/sc:cleanup . --safe-mode
/sc:document . --scope project

# Best practice: Run quality commands before commits and deployments
# Automation: Integrate into CI/CD pipelines for consistent quality
```

**Workflow Commands (Project Management):**
```bash
# Use when: Planning, coordination, complex projects
/sc:workflow "large feature implementation"
/sc:task "project milestone" --breakdown
/sc:spawn "complex system development" --parallel
/sc:estimate "development effort" --detailed

# Best practice: Use workflow commands for >3 step processes
# Planning time: 5 minutes of planning saves 30 minutes of execution
```

### Command Optimization Strategies

**Scope Optimization for Performance:**
```bash
# Inefficient: Broad scope causing slowdowns
/sc:analyze . --scope project             # Analyzes entire project

# Optimized: Targeted scope for speed
/sc:analyze src/components/ --focus quality    # Specific directory
/sc:analyze auth.py --scope file               # Single file analysis
/sc:analyze api/ --focus security --scope module  # Focused analysis

# Performance gains: Faster execution with targeted scope
```

**Context-Aware Command Selection:**
```bash
# For new projects: Discovery-first approach
/sc:brainstorm → /sc:design → /sc:workflow → /sc:implement

# For existing projects: Analysis-first approach  
/sc:load → /sc:analyze → /sc:improve → /sc:test

# For debugging: Systematic approach
/sc:troubleshoot → /sc:analyze --focus problem-area → /sc:implement fix

# For optimization: Measure-first approach
/sc:analyze --focus performance → /sc:improve --measure-impact → /sc:test --benchmark
```

**Command Chaining for Efficiency:**
```bash
# Sequential chaining for dependent operations
/sc:design "API architecture" && /sc:implement "API endpoints" && /sc:test --api-validation

# Parallel chaining for independent operations
/sc:analyze frontend/ --focus performance & /sc:analyze backend/ --focus security & wait

# Conditional chaining for quality gates
/sc:test --coverage && /sc:analyze --focus quality && /sc:improve --safe-mode

# Time savings: Reduced total workflow time through efficient chaining
```

## Basic Flag Usage

### Essential Flag Combinations

**Development Efficiency Flags:**
```bash
# For rapid prototyping
/sc:implement "MVP feature" --scope module --validate
# --scope module: Limited scope for speed
# --validate: Verify changes before applying

# For learning and exploration
/sc:explain "complex architecture" --brainstorm
# --brainstorm: Interactive learning through dialogue

# Development speed: Faster iteration cycles through focused scope
```

**Quality-Focused Flags:**
```bash
# For production-ready development
/sc:implement "payment processing" --validate --safe-mode
# --validate: Pre-execution validation and risk assessment
# --safe-mode: Maximum safety checks and rollback capability

/sc:analyze . --think --focus security
# --think: Standard structured analysis (~4K tokens)
# --focus security: Domain-specific expertise

# Quality improvements: Better validation through systematic checks
```

**Performance-Oriented Flags:**
```bash
# For large codebases (>10 files)
/sc:analyze project/ --scope module --concurrency 2
# --scope module: Limit analysis boundaries
# --concurrency 2: Basic parallel processing

# For resource-conscious development
/sc:implement "feature" --safe-mode

# Focus on exploration and requirements discovery

# Implementation phase
/sc:implement "feature" --validate
# Quality gates without over-optimization

# Testing phase
/sc:test . --coverage --validate
# Comprehensive validation with safety

# Maintenance phase
/sc:improve legacy-code/ --safe-mode --validate
# Conservative improvements with comprehensive testing
```

For detailed flag documentation, see [Flags Guide](../User-Guide/flags.md).

## Session Management Basics

### Simple Session Workflows

**Basic Session Pattern:**
```bash
# Session start
/sc:load "project-name"                  # Restore previous context
/sc:reflect "current state"              # Understand where you left off

# Work session
/sc:implement "today's feature"          # Execute planned work
/sc:test --validate                      # Ensure quality

# Session end
/sc:save "progress-$(date +%m%d)"       # Save current state
```

**Daily Development Cycle:**
```bash
# Morning startup (2 minutes)
/sc:load "current-project"               # Restore context
/sc:workflow "today's priorities"        # Plan daily work

# Development work
/sc:implement "priority task"            # Execute development
/sc:test --coverage                      # Validate changes

# End of day (1 minute)
/sc:save "daily-$(date +%m%d)"         # Preserve progress
```

### Context Preservation

**Checkpoint Strategy:**
```bash
# Before major changes
/sc:save "before-refactor"               # Create restore point

# After completing features
/sc:save "feature-auth-complete"         # Mark completion

# At natural breakpoints
/sc:save "midday-checkpoint"             # Regular progress saves

# Best practice: Save every 30-60 minutes during active development
```

**Session Naming Conventions:**
```bash
# Descriptive session names
/sc:save "auth-module-complete"          # Feature completion
/sc:save "bug-fix-payment-flow"          # Bug resolution
/sc:save "sprint-3-baseline"             # Sprint milestones
/sc:save "before-major-refactor"         # Safety checkpoints

# Date-based sessions
/sc:save "daily-$(date +%Y%m%d)"        # Daily progress
/sc:save "weekly-$(date +%U)"           # Weekly milestones
```

## Daily Workflow Patterns
