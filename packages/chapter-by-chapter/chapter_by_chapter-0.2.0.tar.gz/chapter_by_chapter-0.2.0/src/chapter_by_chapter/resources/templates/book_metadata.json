  "about_author": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) was a British physician and writer who created Sherlock Holmes in 1887, producing four novels and fifty-six short stories that became foundational works in crime fiction. Beyond Holmes, Doyle was remarkably prolific, writing science fiction adventures featuring Professor Challenger, humorous tales of Brigadier Gerard, plus plays, poetry, historical novels, and non-fiction. His early story \"J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement\" (1884) helped popularize the enduring mystery of the Mary Celeste, demonstrating his talent for crafting compelling mysteries even before Holmes made him famous.",
  "about_book": "A Study in Scarlet (1887) introduces the legendary detective duo of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in their first case together. The novel's distinctive title comes from Holmes's own description of murder investigations as a \"study in scarlet\" - finding the red thread of crime woven through ordinary life. Though it received little attention when first published in Beeton's Christmas Annual, this groundbreaking work established many detective fiction conventions, including the famous use of a magnifying glass as an investigative tool. As one of only four full-length Holmes novels, it launched what would become one of literature's most enduring partnerships and helped define the modern detective story.",
