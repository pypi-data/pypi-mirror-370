ðŸŽ‰ And that's a wrap on {{ book.title }} ! We did it, fediverse!

From the very start to the conclusion - we've shared every twist together. This is what the public domain is for: stories that belong to ALL of us, read everyone, one toot at a time.

Thanks for making literature social! See you tomorrow for our next adventure.

{% if next_book %}
We will be starting {{ next_book.title }} by {{ next_book.author }}.

Built with love for the commons, powered by community, shared in the spirit of the fediverse. Because good stories deserve to roam free! ðŸ“šâœ¨
