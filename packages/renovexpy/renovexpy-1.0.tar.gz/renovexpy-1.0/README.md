# Renovexpy

The `renovexpy` package is a Python library developed for the Renovation Explorer project. In its current form, it provides scripts and functions to facilitate the simulation of terraced houses with EnergyPlus and compute KPIs. More functionalities will be added in the future, such as analysis and visualization of the simulation results, surrogate models, sensitivity analysis, and optimization algorithms.
