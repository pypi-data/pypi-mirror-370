"""
    Generate points for an elliptical arc.
    
    Args:
        points: Output vector to store generated points
        normals: Output vector to store normals for each point
        centerx, centery: Center of the ellipse
        radiusx, radiusy: Major and minor radii of the ellipse
        rotation: Rotation of the ellipse in radians
        start_angle, end_angle: Start and end angles in radians
        num_segments: Number of segments to generate (if â‰¤ 0, automatically calculated)
        normals_sign: If True the normals points towards the center the arc instead of the outside.

    The start_angle and end_angle parameters are in the ellipse's own coordinate
    system before rotation is applied.
