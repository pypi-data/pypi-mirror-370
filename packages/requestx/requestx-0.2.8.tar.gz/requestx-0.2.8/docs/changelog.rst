Release Notes
-------------

Version 0.1.0 represents the initial stable release of RequestX. This version provides:

1. **Full Compatibility**: 100% API compatibility with the requests library for easy migration
2. **Performance**: Significant performance improvements through Rust implementation
3. **Modern Features**: Native async/await support and HTTP/2 compatibility
4. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing and documentation

**Breaking Changes from Pre-release**
- None (this is the first stable release)

**Migration from requests**
- Simply change ``import requests`` to ``import requestx as requests``
- All existing code should work without modification
- Optionally use async/await for better performance

**Known Limitations**
- Custom adapters from requests are not supported (use RequestX's native features instead)
- Some advanced requests features may have slightly different behavior (documented in migration guide)

**Supported Platforms**
- Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- Windows (x86_64, ARM64)
- macOS (x86_64, ARM64/Apple Silicon)
- Linux (x86_64, ARM64)

**Dependencies**
- No runtime Python dependencies (all bundled in wheels)
- Rust dependencies are statically linked
