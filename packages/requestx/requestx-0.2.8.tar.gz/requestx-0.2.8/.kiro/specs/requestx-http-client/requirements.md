# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The requestx project aims to create a high-performance HTTP client library for Python that leverages Rust's speed and memory safety while maintaining full compatibility with the popular `requests` API. The library will provide both synchronous and asynchronous request capabilities, be easily installable via pip, and include comprehensive testing and benchmarking to validate performance advantages over existing solutions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want to make HTTP requests using a familiar requests-like API, so that I can easily adopt and migrate requests into requestx without  effort. 

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer imports requestx THEN the library SHALL provide get(), post(), put(), delete(), head(), options(), and patch() methods
2. WHEN a developer calls requestx.get(url) THEN the library SHALL return a Response object with the same interface as requests.Response
3. WHEN a developer uses requestx with existing requests code THEN the library SHALL work as a drop-in replacement without code changes
4. WHEN a developer accesses response.status_code, response.text, response.json(), response.headers THEN the library SHALL provide identical behavior to requests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want both synchronous and asynchronous HTTP request capabilities, so that I can choose the appropriate approach for my application's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer uses the synchronous API THEN the library SHALL block until the request completes
2. WHEN a developer uses the async API THEN the library SHALL return awaitable coroutines
3. WHEN a developer calls await requestx.get(url) THEN the library SHALL provide non-blocking HTTP requests
4. WHEN a developer uses the async API THEN the library SHALL be compatible with asyncio event loops

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want superior performance compared to existing HTTP libraries, so that my applications can handle more requests with lower latency and memory usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making HTTP requests THEN requestx SHALL demonstrate faster request throughput than the requests library
2. WHEN making concurrent requests THEN requestx SHALL use less memory than comparable Python HTTP libraries
3. WHEN handling large response bodies THEN requestx SHALL process data more efficiently than requests
4. WHEN running performance benchmarks THEN requestx SHALL show measurable improvements in speed and memory usage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want to easily install the library using pip, so that I can integrate it into my projects without complex setup procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs pip install requestx THEN the library SHALL install successfully on supported platforms
2. WHEN installing on Windows, macOS, and Linux THEN the library SHALL provide pre-built wheels
3. WHEN the library is installed THEN all Rust dependencies SHALL be bundled and require no additional setup
4. WHEN importing requestx after installation THEN the library SHALL load without errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want comprehensive documentation, so that I can understand how to use all features of the library effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer visits the documentation THEN they SHALL find complete API reference documentation
2. WHEN a developer looks for examples THEN the documentation SHALL provide code samples for common use cases
3. WHEN a developer needs migration guidance THEN the documentation SHALL explain differences from requests
4. WHEN a developer wants performance information THEN the documentation SHALL include benchmark results

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated testing and CI/CD pipelines, so that code quality is maintained and releases are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically run all tests
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the CI pipeline SHALL build wheels for all supported platforms
3. WHEN a release is tagged THEN the CI pipeline SHALL automatically publish to PyPI
4. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL cover both Python and Rust components

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive unit tests using Python's unittest framework, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN all HTTP methods SHALL be tested with various scenarios
2. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the library SHALL handle network errors, timeouts, and invalid responses gracefully
3. WHEN testing async functionality THEN all asynchronous methods SHALL be validated
4. WHEN running tests THEN code coverage SHALL be measured and maintained at a high level

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to use modern Python tooling with uv for dependency management, so that development is efficient and reproducible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN uv SHALL manage Python dependencies
2. WHEN installing development dependencies THEN uv SHALL provide fast and reliable package resolution
3. WHEN creating virtual environments THEN uv SHALL handle environment isolation
4. WHEN building the project THEN uv SHALL coordinate with Rust build tools

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to use Cargo for Rust dependency management, so that Rust components are properly managed and built.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the Rust components THEN Cargo SHALL manage all Rust dependencies
2. WHEN updating Rust dependencies THEN Cargo.toml SHALL specify version constraints
3. WHEN building for different platforms THEN Cargo SHALL handle cross-compilation requirements
4. WHEN integrating with PyO3 THEN Cargo SHALL properly configure Python bindings

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want performance and memory benchmarking capabilities, so that I can validate and demonstrate the library's advantages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running benchmarks THEN the system SHALL compare requestx performance against requests and httpx
2. WHEN measuring throughput THEN benchmarks SHALL test various request sizes and concurrency levels
3. WHEN measuring memory usage THEN benchmarks SHALL track memory consumption over time
4. WHEN benchmarks complete THEN results SHALL be formatted for documentation and reporting
