                                  direction.  This is useful for preventing the motor

                        attempts to hold the motor's bemf. If user expects motor to

        Motion MagicÂ® Velocity produces a motion profile in real-time while

        This control mode does not use the CruiseVelocity, Expo_kV, or Expo_kA

                          FOC improves motor performance by leveraging torque (current)

                          CTR-Electronics has developed a hybrid method that combines
                          the performances gains of FOC while still allowing
                          applications to provide duty cycle or voltage demand.  This
                          not to be confused with simple sinusoidal control or phase
                          voltage control which lacks the performance gains.
            - feed_forward: Feedforward to apply in fractional units between -1 and +1.
            - slot: Select which gains are applied by selecting the slot.  Use the
                    configuration api to set the gain values for the selected slot

                                          output is zero, which is to provide 0V to the

            - limit_forward_motion: Set to true to force forward limiting.  This allows

                                      This can be useful on mechanisms such as an
                                      intake/feeder, where a limit switch stops motion
                                      while intaking but should be ignored when feeding
                                      to a shooter.

            - feed_forward: Feedforward to apply in volts

                    configuration api to set the gain values for the selected slot
                    before enabling this feature. Slot must be within [0,2].

            - limit_forward_motion: Set to true to force forward limiting.  This allows
                                    users to use other limit switch sensors connected to
                                    robot controller.  This also allows use of active
                                    sensors that require external power.
            - limit_reverse_motion: Set to true to force reverse limiting.  This allows
                                    users to use other limit switch sensors connected to

                                      parameters, instead allowing motion.
                                      
                                      This can be useful on mechanisms such as an
                                      intake/feeder, where a limit switch stops motion
                                      while intaking but should be ignored when feeding
                                      to a shooter.

                                      switches regardless of this parameter.
            - use_timesync: Set to true to delay applying this control request until a
                            timesync boundary (requires Phoenix Pro and CANivore). This
                            eliminates the impact of nondeterministic network delays in
                            exchange for a larger but deterministic control latency.
                            
                            This requires setting the ControlTimesyncFreqHz config in

        Motion MagicÂ® produces a motion profile in real-time while attempting

        Target position can be changed on-the-fly and Motion MagicÂ® will do
        its best to adjust the profile. This control mode is based on torque

                    Jerk is optional; if this is set to zero, then Motion MagicÂ® will
                    not apply a Jerk limit.
            - feed_forward: Feedforward to apply in torque current in Amperes.  User can
