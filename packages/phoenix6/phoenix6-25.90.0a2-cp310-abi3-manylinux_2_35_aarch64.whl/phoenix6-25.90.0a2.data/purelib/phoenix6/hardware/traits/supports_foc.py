        """
        Request a specified motor current (field oriented control).
        
        This control request will drive the motor to the requested motor
        (stator) current value.  This leverages field oriented control (FOC),
        which means greater peak power than what is documented.  This scales
        to torque based on Motor's kT constant.
        
        - TorqueCurrentFOC Parameters: 
            - output: Amount of motor current in Amperes
            - max_abs_duty_cycle: The maximum absolute motor output that can be applied,
                                  which effectively limits the velocity. For example,
                                  0.50 means no more than 50% output in either
                                  direction.  This is useful for preventing the motor
                                  from spinning to its terminal velocity when there is
                                  no external torque applied unto the rotor.  Note this
                                  is absolute maximum, so the value should be between
                                  zero and one.
            - deadband: Deadband in Amperes.  If torque request is within deadband, the
                        bridge output is neutral. If deadband is set to zero then there
                        is effectively no deadband. Note if deadband is zero, a free
                        spinning motor will spin for quite a while as the firmware
                        attempts to hold the motor's bemf. If user expects motor to
                        cease spinning quickly with a demand of zero, we recommend a
                        deadband of one Ampere. This value will be converted to an
                        integral value of amps.
            - override_coast_dur_neutral: Set to true to coast the rotor when output is
                                          zero (or within deadband).  Set to false to
                                          use the NeutralMode configuration setting
                                          (default). This flag exists to provide the
                                          fundamental behavior of this control when
                                          output is zero, which is to provide 0A (zero
                                          torque).
            - limit_forward_motion: Set to true to force forward limiting.  This allows
                                    users to use other limit switch sensors connected to
                                    robot controller.  This also allows use of active
                                    sensors that require external power.
            - limit_reverse_motion: Set to true to force reverse limiting.  This allows
                                    users to use other limit switch sensors connected to

                                    sensors that require external power.
            - ignore_hardware_limits: Set to true to ignore hardware limit switches and
                                      the LimitForwardMotion and LimitReverseMotion
                                      parameters, instead allowing motion.
                                      
                                      This can be useful on mechanisms such as an
                                      intake/feeder, where a limit switch stops motion
                                      while intaking but should be ignored when feeding
                                      to a shooter.
                                      
                                      The hardware limit faults and Forward/ReverseLimit
                                      signals will still report the values of the limit
                                      switches regardless of this parameter.
            - use_timesync: Set to true to delay applying this control request until a
                            timesync boundary (requires Phoenix Pro and CANivore). This
                            eliminates the impact of nondeterministic network delays in
                            exchange for a larger but deterministic control latency.
                            
                            This requires setting the ControlTimesyncFreqHz config in
                            MotorOutputConfigs. Additionally, when this is enabled, the

        Requests Motion MagicÂ® to target a final velocity using a motion

        Motion MagicÂ® Velocity produces a motion profile in real-time while

        This control mode does not use the CruiseVelocity, Expo_kV, or Expo_kA

        If the specified acceleration is zero, the Acceleration under Motion
        MagicÂ® configuration parameter is used instead.  This allows for
        runtime adjustment of acceleration for advanced users.  Jerk is also
        specified in the Motion MagicÂ® persistent configuration values.  If
        Jerk is set to zero, Motion MagicÂ® will produce a trapezoidal
        acceleration profile.
        
        Target velocity can also be changed on-the-fly and Motion MagicÂ® will

                            Acceleration is in rotations per second squared.  If

                          FOC improves motor performance by leveraging torque (current)

                                      The hardware limit faults and Forward/ReverseLimit
                                      signals will still report the values of the limit

            - use_timesync: Set to true to delay applying this control request until a
                            timesync boundary (requires Phoenix Pro and CANivore). This
                            eliminates the impact of nondeterministic network delays in
                            exchange for a larger but deterministic control latency.
                            
                            This requires setting the ControlTimesyncFreqHz config in
                            MotorOutputConfigs. Additionally, when this is enabled, the
                            UpdateFreqHz of this request should be set to 0 Hz.
