    Class for getting information about an available CAN bus.

    A CANBus can optionally be constructed with an associated
    hoot file, which loads it for replay (equivalent to calling
    HootReplay.load_file).

    Only one hoot log may be replayed at a time, so only one CAN
    bus should be constructed with a hoot file.

    When using relative paths, the file path is typically relative
    to the top-level folder of the robot project.

    For the SystemCore built-in CAN buses, use CANBus.system_core(int, str) instead.

    :param canbus: Name of the CAN bus. Possible CAN bus strings are:

        - "can_s0" to "can_s4" for the native SystemCore buses

        - SocketCAN interface (non-FRC Linux only)
        - "*" for any CANivore seen by the program
        - empty string (default) to select the default for the system:

            - "can_s0" on SystemCore
            - "can0" on Linux
            - "*" on Windows
