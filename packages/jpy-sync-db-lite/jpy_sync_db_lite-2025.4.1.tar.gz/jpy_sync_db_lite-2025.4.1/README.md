## Performance Optimizations

The library includes several SQLite-specific optimizations:

- **WAL mode** for better concurrency
- **Configurable cache settings** (via PRAGMA)
- **Memory-mapped files** (via PRAGMA)
- **Query planner optimization**
- **Static connection pooling**

## Thread Safety

All operations are thread-safe via a single persistent connection protected by locks.
Requests are executed serially to ensure SQLite correctness, while remaining safe to call from multiple threads.

## Performance Testing

The library includes comprehensive performance testing tools to help you optimize your database operations.

### Quick Performance Check

Run the standalone benchmark script for a quick performance overview:

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
python tests/benchmark_db_engine.py

# Run specific tests
python tests/benchmark_db_engine.py --tests single bulk select scaling batch

# Customize parameters
python tests/benchmark_db_engine.py --operations 2000 --workers 2 --batch-sizes 100 500 1000
```

### Comprehensive Performance Tests

Run the full unittest suite for detailed performance analysis:

```bash
# Run all performance tests
python -m unittest tests.test_db_engine_performance -v
```

### Performance Test Categories

#### 1. Single Insert Performance
- Measures individual insert operation latency and throughput
- **Expected**: >50 ops/sec, <100ms average latency

#### 2. Bulk Insert Performance
- Tests different batch sizes (10, 50, 100, 250 records)
- Measures throughput and per-record latency
- **Expected**: >100 ops/sec for optimal batch sizes

#### 3. Select Performance
- Tests various query types:
  - Simple SELECT with LIMIT
  - Filtered SELECT with WHERE clauses
  - Indexed SELECT using indexed columns
  - Aggregate SELECT with COUNT/AVG
  - Complex SELECT with multiple conditions and ORDER BY
- **Expected**: >200 ops/sec for simple selects

#### 4. Batch Performance
- Tests batch SQL execution with multiple statements
- Measures performance of mixed DDL/DML operations
- Tests different batch sizes and statement types
- **Expected**: >100 ops/sec for batch operations

#### 5. Concurrent Operations Performance
- Tests performance under concurrent load (1, 2, 4, 8 threads)
- Mix of read and write operations
- **Expected**: >50 ops/sec under load

#### 6. Transaction Performance
- Tests transaction operations with different sizes
- **Expected**: >50 ops/sec for transactions

#### 7. Benchmark-like Behavioral Checks
- Lightweight concurrency and throughput checks derived from the standalone benchmark
- Runs quickly in CI while validating behavior under threaded access

### Performance Metrics

The tests measure:

- **Throughput**: Operations per second (ops/sec)
- **Latency**: Time per operation in milliseconds
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption and growth rate (optional, requires `psutil`)
- **Concurrency Scaling**: Performance with multiple threads

### Performance Expectations

Based on SQLite with WAL mode and optimized pragmas:

| Operation Type | Expected Throughput | Expected Latency |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Single Insert  | >50 ops/sec       | <100ms avg       |
| Bulk Insert    | >100 ops/sec      | <50ms per record |
| Simple Select  | >200 ops/sec      | <10ms avg        |
| Complex Select | >50 ops/sec       | <50ms avg        |
| Batch Operations| >100 ops/sec      | <100ms avg       |
| Transactions   | >50 ops/sec       | <100ms avg       |
| Concurrent Ops | >50 ops/sec       | <100ms avg       |


### Optimization Recommendations

The performance tests provide recommendations for:
- **Optimal batch sizes** for bulk operations
- **Optimal worker threads** for your workload
- **Memory efficiency** analysis
- **Scaling considerations** for concurrent operations

### Memory Monitoring (Optional)

Memory usage monitoring is optional and requires the `psutil` package:

```bash
pip install psutil
```

**Note**: `psutil` is not a dependency of this package. Without `psutil`, the tests will run normally but skip memory measurements.

### Performance Troubleshooting

Common performance issues and solutions:

1. **Low throughput**: Use batch operations, optimize worker count
2. **High latency**: Check for blocking operations, monitor system resources
3. **Memory growth**: Look for unclosed connections or large result sets
4. **Concurrency issues**: SQLite has limitations with concurrent writes

For detailed performance analysis, see [tests/PERFORMANCE_TESTS.md](tests/PERFORMANCE_TESTS.md).
