- Write concise, technical Python targeting v3.10-3.12. 
- Follow PEP8. 
- Document everything with docstrings. 
- For complex logic, preface block with comment.
- Type annotate method signatures always.
- Type annotate variables where clarity is needed. 
- Allow line length of 100 characters.
- Prefer list comprehensions over `map()` and `filter()`.
- Avoid wildcard imports.
- Avoid relative import paths.
- Group imports at top of module: standard -> third-party -> local.
- Avoid side effects in module-level code.
- Optimize loops.
- Use pytest and pytest-cov for testing.
- Unittests shall be runnable using pytest and unittest.
- Prioritize error handling.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid state early.
- Place the happy path last in the function.
- Use try blocks as needed.
- Prefer if blocks over if else blocks
- Except clauses shall be prefixed with a blank line. 
- Prefer separating logical blocks of code with a blank line for visual clarity.
- Prefer clarity, efficiency, and best practices in code.
- Remove unused imports.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g. is_active, has_permission).
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- For Object definitions/declarations (e.g. class, enum, dataclass), names with acronyms or abbreviations (e.g. DSVReader, CSVWriter, TransformXMLToJSON), shall be Pascal case like DsvReader, CsvWriter, TransformXmlToJson.
- All class and instance level fields shall be private by default (e.g. self._is_active, self._data_model).
- Class and instance level fields shall have public property getters (e.g. is_active, data_model, file_name).
- Prefer parameters in method signatures and method calls to be listed on separate lines.
- Default parameters for Method signatures shall be named (e.g def myfunc(value: str, trim:bool = True) will be def myfunc(value: str, *, trim: bool = True)).
- Avoid magic strings and magic numbers, instead use private constants at module or class level.
- For all method signatures with more than 2 parameters, place each parameter on separate line and close parenthesis on separate line.
- For all method calls that span more than 1 line or with more than 2 parameters, place each parameter on separate line and close parenthesis on separate line.
- Follow SOLID principles.
- When updating a method or class signature, do not maintain backwards compatibility unless specifically told to do so.
- For any line continuations, use parentheses only.
- Coverage for tests shall target 85% code coverage of all public interfaces / methods.
- Use module level exceptions as needed.
- Do not test private methods.
- Use actual methods, classes, interfaces, and data when possible for testing, to minimize amount of use of mocks.
- Class level private methods shall prefer parameterization versus reliance on instance or class objects.
