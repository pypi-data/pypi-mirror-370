# About

`garminexport` is both a library and a tool for downloading/backing up
[Garmin Connect](http://connect.garmin.com/) activities to local disk.

The main utility script is called `garmin-backup` and performs incremental
backups of your Garmin account to a local directory. The first time
`garmin-backup` is run, it will download _all_ activities. After that, it will
do incremental backups of your account. That is, the script will only download
activities that haven't already been downloaded to the backup directory.

# Installation

`garminexport` is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) and can be installed
with [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org).

```bash
pip install garminexport
```

# Usage

## Prerequisites

To be of any use you need to register an account at
[Garmin Connect](http://connect.garmin.com/) and populate it with some
activities.

## Authentication

Logging in with the user-supplied username and password gives `garminexport` two
important pieces of data needed to authenticate further client requests:

- An OAuth bearer token.
- A `JWT_FGP` cookie.

These are both stored under `~/.garmexport` (or the folder given by
`--auth-token-dir`) and will be reused as long as the OAuth token has not
expired. Only if the OAuth token has expired (normally after two hours) will a
new login be initiated. Doing too many logins in a short period of time risks
seeing your IP address being temporarily blocked by CloudFlare (normally
indicated by a `429 (Too Many Requests)` response). The reuse of authentication
tokens should make this a non-issue though.

## As a command-line tool (garmin-backup)

The backup program is run as follows (use the `--help` flag for a full list of
available options):

```bash
garmin-backup --backup-dir=activities <username or email>
```

Once started, the program will prompt you for your account password and then log
in to your Garmin Connect account to download activities to the specified backup
directory on your machine. The program will only download activities that aren't
already in the backup directory.

Activities can be exported in any of the formats outlined below. Note that by
default, the program downloads all formats for every activity. Use the
`--format` option to narrow the selection.

Supported export formats:

- `gpx`: activity GPX file (XML).

  <sub>[GPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format) is an open
  format, mainly for storing GPS routes/tracks. It does support extensions and
  Garmin appears to annotate the GPS data with, for example, heart-rate and
  cadence, when available on your device.</sub>

- `tcx`: an activity TCX file (XML). _Note: a `.tcx` file may not always be
  possible to export, for example if an activity was uploaded in gpx format. In
  that case, Garmin won't try to synthesize a tcx file._

  <sub>[TCX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Center_XML) (Training Center
  XML) is Garmin's own XML format. It is, essentially, an extension of GPX which
  includes more metrics and divides the GPS track into "laps" as recorded by
  your device (with "lap summaries" for each metric).</sub>

- `fit`: activity FIT file (binary format). _Note: a `.fit` file may not always
  be possible to export, for example if an activity was entered manually rather
  than imported from a Garmin device._

  <sub>The [FIT](https://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit/) format is the "raw
  data type" stored in your Garmin device and should contain all metrics your
  device is capable of tracking (GPS, heart rate, cadence, etc). It's a binary
  format, so tools are needed to read its content.</sub>

- `json_summary`: activity summary file (JSON).

  <sub>Provides summary data for an activity. Seems to lack a formal schema and
  should not be counted on as a stable data format (it may change at any time).
  Only included since it _may_ contain additional data that could be useful for
  developers of analysis tools.</sub>

- `json_details`: activity details file (JSON).

  <sub>Provides detailed activity data in a JSON format. Seems to lack a formal
  schema and should not be counted on as a stable data format (it may change at
  any time). Only included since it _may_ contain additional data that could be
  useful for developers of analysis tools.</sub>

All files are written to the same directory (`activities/` by default). Each
activity file is prefixed by its upload timestamp and its activity id.

`garminexport` also contains a few smaller utility programs:

- `garmin-get-activity`: download a single Garmin Connect activity. Run with
  `--help`for more details.
- `garmin-upload-activity`: uplad a single Garmin Connect activity file (`.fit`,
  `.gpx`, or `.tcx`). Run with `--help`for more details.

## As a library

To build your own tools around the Garmin Connect API you can import the
`garminclient` module. It handles authentication to establish a secure session
with Garmin Connect. For example use, have a look at the command-line tools
under [garminexport/cli](garminexport/cli).

For example, in your `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml`
([PEP 631](https://peps.python.org/pep-0631/)) add something like:

```python
install_requires=[
    'garminexport',
    ...
]
```

# Contribute

To start working on the code, create a virtual environment (an isolated
development environment) and install the required dependencies like so:

    # create virtualenv and populate it with library dependencies
    make dev-init

    # activate virtualenv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # test
    make test
