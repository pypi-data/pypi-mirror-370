**Space Robotics Bench (SRB)** is a comprehensive collection of environments and tasks for robotics research in the challenging domain of space. It provides a unified framework for developing and validating autonomous systems under diverse extraterrestrial scenarios. At the same time, its design is flexible and extensible to accommodate a variety of development workflows and research directions beyond Earth.

## Key Features

- **Highly Parallelized Simulation via [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim)**: SRB supports thousands of parallel simulation instances to accelerate workflows such as online learning, synthetic dataset generation, parameter tuning, and validation.

- **On-Demand Procedural Generation with [SimForge](https://github.com/AndrejOrsula/simforge)**: Automated procedural generation of simulation assets is leveraged to provide a unique scenario for each simulation instance, with the ultimate goal of developing autonomous systems that are both robust and adaptable to the unpredictable domain of space.

- **Extensive Domain Randomization**: All simulation instances can be further randomized to enhance the generalization of autonomous agents towards variable environment dynamics, visual appearance, illumination conditions, as well as sensor and actuation noise.

- **Compatibility with [Gymnasium API](https://gymnasium.farama.org)**: All tasks are compatible with a standardized API to ensure seamless integration with a broad ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for robot learning research.

- **Seamless Interface with [ROS 2](https://ros.org) & [Space ROS](https://space.ros.org)**: Simulation states, sensory outputs and actions of autonomous systems are available through ROS 2 middleware interface, enabling direct interoperability with the vast (Space) ROS ecosystem.

- **Abstract Architecture**: The architecture of SRB is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration of new assets, robots, tasks and workflows
