Subject: Re: ModelAudit Enterprise Edition and Technical Issues

Hi Aakash,

Thanks for checking in. Here's where we stand on each item:

1. Enterprise Edition Setup
We'll have the enterprise UI turned on for your account by Friday. I'll send access details once it's ready.

2. ZIP Entry Size Errors  
We've fixed this. The issue was that our file size limits were too small for your large models. Please update to the latest version and test again.

3. Model Scan Failures
We've improved the error handling for those RoBERTa models that were failing silently. You should now get clear error messages instead of null exit codes. Please update to the latest version and test with your RoBERTa models.

I'm also attaching a list of recommended test models we use for validation: https://gist.github.com/mldangelo/48901736facaac525251bad7084cc4bb

These include models with known security issues that should trigger alerts, plus some safe models for comparison. 

Also, could you share some examples of the specific models you've been testing? Especially any where you've found security issues that ModelAudit hasn't caught - we'd love to test against those to improve our detection capabilities.

Let me know how it goes.

Best,
Michael
