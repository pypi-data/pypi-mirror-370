"""Interrupt handling for ModelAudit scanning operations.

This module provides centralized interrupt handling for graceful shutdown
of scanning operations. It captures SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGTERM signals
and allows scanners to check for interruption at safe points.

Usage:
    # In scanning loops:
    from modelaudit.interrupt_handler import check_interrupted

    for file in files:
        check_interrupted()  # Raises KeyboardInterrupt if interrupted
        scan_file(file)

    # For main scanning context:
    from modelaudit.interrupt_handler import interruptible_scan

    with interruptible_scan() as handler:
        # Signal handlers are installed
        perform_scanning()
        # Signal handlers are restored on exit
