# Configuration options for how to run Gaussian

[docker]
# The code to use. This may maybe more than just the name of the code, and variables in
# braces {} will be expanded. For example:
#   code = mpiexec -np {NTASKS} lmp_mpi
# would expand {NTASKS} to the number of tasks and run the command

code = g09

# The name and location of the Docker container to use, optionally with the version

container = ghcr.io/molssi-seamm/seamm-gaussian:{version}

# In addition, you can specify the platform to use. This is useful on e.g. Macs with
# app silicon (M1, M3...) where the default platform is linux/arm64 but some containers
# are only available for linux/amd64.

# platform = linux/amd64

[local]
# The type of local installation to use. Options are:
#     conda: Use a conda environment
#   modules: Use the modules system
#     local: Use a local installation
#    docker: Use a Docker container
# By default you need to install Gaussian locally and use 'local'

installation = local

# The command line to use, which should start with the executable followed by any options.
# Variables in braces {} will be expanded. For example:
#
#   code = mpiexec -np {NTASKS} lmp_mpi
#
# would expand {NTASKS} to the number of tasks and run the command.
# For a 'local' installation, the command line should include the full path to the
# executable or it should be in the path. 

code = g09

# The root directory of the Gaussian installation. The 'gxx' directory should be in
# this directory. e.g.
# root-directory = /Users/psaxe/Software

# The file to source to set up the Gaussian environment, e.g.
# setup-environment = /Users/psaxe/Software/g09/bsd/g09.profile

#---------------------- modules section ---------------------------
# The modules to load to run Gaussian, as a list of strings.
# For example, to load the modules gaussian and openmpi, you would use:
#   modules = gaussian openmpi

# modules = 

#------------------------ local section ---------------------------
# The full path to the Gaussian executable should be in the 'code' option.

#------------------------ docker section --------------------------
# The name and location of the Docker container to use, optionally with the version.
# {version} will be expanded to the version of the plug-in.

# container = ghcr.io/molssi-seamm/seamm-gaussian:{version}

# In addition, you can specify the platform to use. This is useful on e.g. Macs with
# app silicon (M1, M3...) where the default platform is linux/arm64 but some containers
# are only available for linux/amd64.

# platform = linux/amd64
