To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to Accounting/Reporting/NL ICP statement
2. Handle the same way you'd handle a BTW statement
3. Note there will be an extra column "Error" if some partner is misconfigured for ICP and you won't be able to post/finalize the statement until you've corrected the errors
