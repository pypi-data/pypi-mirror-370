# pyscan-stats

**[pyscan-stats](https://pypi.org/project/pyscan-stats/)** is a Python package for spatial scan statistics, created from a fork of the original **[pyscan](https://github.com/michaelmathen/pyscan)** library by Michael Matheny.

## User Installation

Wheels for Linux and macOS 14+ are available on PyPI. To install, run:

```bash
pip install pyscan-stats
```

## Documentation

1. Read the original documentation at [https://michaelmathen.github.io/pyscan/](https://michaelmathen.github.io/pyscan/)
2. Ready to run examples with data are available at: [https://github.com/simonpedrogonzalez/pyscan-stats-resources](https://github.com/simonpedrogonzalez/pyscan-stats-resources)

# New Features

## Faster Numpy-based Net Grid Constructor

```python
grid = pyscan.Grid(
    unique_xs, unique_ys, # (N,) numpy arrays of sorted unique x and y coordinates
    m_arr, b_arr # (N, 3) numpy arrays (x, y, weight)
    )
```

Removes the burden of instantiating in Python the `pyscan.WPoint` for each data point, which can be slow for larger datasets.

## Area-Limited Max Convex Subgrid Scan

```python
prec = 1e-3
disc_f = pyscan.RKULLDORF
max_area = 750 # Maximum number of pixels in the subgrid
max_subgrid = pyscan.max_subgrid_convex(grid, prec, disc_f, max_area)
```

Allows for specifying a maximum area for the subgrid, useful when the interest is in smaller anomalies or when computational resources are limited. Usage example [here](https://github.com/simonpedrogonzalez/pyscan-stats-resources/blob/master/8_AreaLimitedGridScanning.py). The implementation uses a sliding window version of Kadane's algorithm.

## Improvements

- Support for new Python versions (3.10+)
- Project dependency update and organization for easier extension and maintenance.
- Updated examples.

# Dev installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/simonpedrogonzalez/pyscan`.
1. [Install `uv` package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer) if not already installed (you can use other package managers).
2. Install CMake, Boost, GSL, CGAL if not already installed. For example, on Mac:
    ```bash
    brew install cmake boost gsl cgal
    ```
3. Run `make init` to create a Python 3.12 venv in `.venv` and install dev dependencies.

You are all set to start developing! The following utility commands are available:

- `make cpp`: compiles C++ code into the `build/` directory.
- `make py`: builds the Python package and installs it in the venv, with the last compiled cpp binaries.
- `make test`: runs the C++ tests, only works after compiling the C++ code.
- `make clean`: removes `build/`, `dist/` and packaging artifacts.

Notes:
If an error occurs executing one of the commands, try:
- Manually activating the venv `source .venv/bin/activate` and running the command again.
- Running `make clean` before `make cpp` to ensure a clean build.
- This setup was tested both on macOS (15.6, M2) and Linux (Ubuntu 20.04).
