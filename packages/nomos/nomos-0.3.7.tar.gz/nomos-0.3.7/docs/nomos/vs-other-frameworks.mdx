      ### Reliability & Predictability

      <Warning>
      **Prompt-Based Frameworks Challenge**

      Both LangChain and CrewAI rely heavily on prompt engineering, where small changes can have dramatic effects on agent behavior.
      </Warning>

      <Info>
      **NOMOS Advantage**

      State machine architecture ensures predictable behavior paths and controlled transitions between agent states.

      ### Monitoring & Observability

      | Feature | LangChain | CrewAI | NOMOS |
      |---------|-----------|---------|--------|
      | **Step Tracing** | ⚠️ Chain level | ⚠️ Agent level | ✅ Granular steps |
      | **Tool Usage Tracking** | Limited | ❌ Basic | ✅ Comprehensive |
      | **Decision Audit Trail** | ❌ Minimal | ❌ High-level | ✅ Complete |
      | **Performance Metrics** | ⚠️ Basic | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Detailed |

## Migration Strategies

<Tip>
**Gradual Migration Approach**

You don't have to choose between frameworks permanently. Many teams start with rapid prototyping in LangChain or CrewAI, then migrate critical workflows to NOMOS for production deployment.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Core Workflows">
    Map out your agent's decision points and tool usage patterns from your existing implementation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design NOMOS Flows">
    Use our Playground to visually design the equivalent structured workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Incremental Implementation">
    Start with the most critical or complex parts of your agent, leaving simpler components for later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Testing & Validation">
    Leverage NOMOS testing capabilities to ensure your migrated agent maintains expected behavior.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Full Deployment">
    Replace your existing implementation with the more robust NOMOS version.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration Possibilities
