## What are Flows?

Flows are containers that group related steps together and provide:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Shared Memory"
    icon="brain"
  >
    Each flow maintains its own context that persists across steps within the flow
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Component Management"
    icon="puzzle-piece"
  >
    Flows can have dedicated components like memory systems, specialized tools, or custom handlers
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Context Transfer"
    icon="arrows-turn-right"
  >
    When transitioning between flows, context is intelligently summarized and passed along
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Entry/Exit Points"
    icon="door-open"
  >
    Define which steps can enter or exit a flow for better control flow management
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Flow Configuration

You can define flows in your YAML configuration:

```yaml
# Basic agent configuration
name: advanced-assistant
persona: A helpful assistant with specialized workflows
start_step_id: greeting

steps:
  - step_id: greeting
    description: Greet the user and understand their needs
    routes:
      - target: order_taking
        condition: User wants to place an order
      - target: customer_support
        condition: User needs help or support

  - step_id: order_taking
    description: Handle order details and preferences
    available_tools:
      - get_menu_items
      - add_to_cart
    routes:
      - target: order_confirmation
        condition: Order is complete

  - step_id: order_confirmation
    description: Confirm order details and process payment
    available_tools:
      - calculate_total
      - process_payment
    routes:
      - target: farewell
        condition: Order is confirmed

  - step_id: customer_support
    description: Handle customer inquiries and issues
    available_tools:
      - search_knowledge_base
      - escalate_to_human
    routes:
      - target: farewell
        condition: Issue is resolved

  - step_id: farewell
    description: Thank the user and end the conversation

# Enhanced flows configuration
flows:
  - flow_id: order_management    # Can also use 'id'
    description: "Complete order processing workflow"  # Can also use 'desc'
    enters:
      - order_taking
    exits:
      - order_confirmation
      - farewell
    components:
      memory:
        llm:
          provider: openai
          model: gpt-4o-mini
        retriever:
          method: embedding
          kwargs:
            k: 5

  - flow_id: support_workflow
    description: "Customer support and issue resolution"
    enters:
      - customer_support
    exits:
      - farewell
    components:
      memory:
        llm:
          provider: openai
          model: gpt-4o-mini
        retriever:
          method: embedding
```

## Flow Memory and Context

Each flow can have its own memory system that:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Preserves Context">
    Maintains conversation history and important details within the flow
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Intelligent Retrieval">
    Uses BM25 or other retrieval methods to find relevant information
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Context Summarization">
    Automatically summarizes context when exiting a flow
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cross-Flow Transfer">
    Passes summarized context when transitioning between flows
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Flow Benefits

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Architecture">
    **Organized Architecture**: Keep related functionality grouped together

    Flows help you organize your agent's capabilities into logical groups, making your codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Context">
    **Context Awareness**: Maintain relevant information throughout related interactions

    Each flow maintains its own context, ensuring that relevant information persists throughout the workflow.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Scalability">
    **Scalable Design**: Easily extend your agent with new flows without affecting existing ones

    Add new workflows without disrupting existing functionality.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Memory">
    **Memory Efficiency**: Each flow only maintains context relevant to its purpose

    Optimize memory usage by keeping only relevant context within each flow.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Control">
    **Flexible Transitions**: Define precise entry and exit conditions for better control flow

    Control exactly when and how users can transition between different workflows.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Example: Barista Agent with Flows

The barista example demonstrates flow usage for order management:

```yaml
flows:
  - flow_id: take_coffee_order
    description: "Complete coffee ordering process"
    enters:
      - take_coffee_order
    exits:
      - finalize_order
      - end
    components:
      memory:
        llm:
          provider: openai
          model: gpt-4o-mini
        retriever:
          method: embedding
```

<Note>
This flow ensures that all order-related context (customer preferences, cart contents, order history) is maintained throughout the ordering process and properly summarized when the order is complete.
</Note>

### Multi-Flow Applications

You can create sophisticated applications by combining multiple flows:

```yaml
flows:
  - flow_id: authentication
    description: "User login and verification"
    enters: [login]
    exits: [dashboard, main_menu]

  - flow_id: order_processing
    description: "Handle customer orders"
    enters: [order_taking]
    exits: [checkout, main_menu]

  - flow_id: customer_support
    description: "Handle customer inquiries"
    enters: [support_request]
    exits: [resolution, escalation]
```

### Flow Transitions

<Info>
Flows automatically handle context transfer when users move between different workflows, ensuring seamless user experience while maintaining relevant information.

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Single Responsibility"
    icon="target"
  >
    Each flow should handle one specific type of workflow or business logic
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Clear Entry Points"
    icon="door-open"
  >
    Define clear conditions for when users should enter each flow
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Context Management"
    icon="database"
  >
    Keep flow contexts focused and relevant to avoid information overload
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Exit Strategies"
    icon="door-closed"
  >
    Always provide clear exit paths from each flow
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Configuration Validation

Use the `nomos validate` command to check your flow configuration:

```bash
nomos validate config.agent.yaml --verbose
```

This validates:
- Flow ID uniqueness
- Entry/exit step references
- Component configuration
- Field naming compatibility (supports both `id`/`flow_id` and `desc`/`description`)

<Note>
**Field Naming Flexibility**

NOMOS supports both compact (`id`, `desc`) and descriptive (`flow_id`, `description`) field names for flows. You can use either convention consistently in your configuration.
</Note>
