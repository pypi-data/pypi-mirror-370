## What Are Steps?

<Info>
**Steps = Focused Responsibilities**

Each step has a single, well-defined purpose in your agent's workflow. This decomposition makes complex agent behavior manageable and predictable.

## Step Anatomy

### Basic Step Structure

```yaml
steps:
  - step_id: greet_customer  # Can also use 'id'
    description: |            # Can also use 'desc'
      Welcome the customer and understand their needs.
      Ask how you can help them today and listen for their response.
    available_tools: []       # Can also use 'tools'
    routes:                   # Can also use 'paths'
      - target: take_order    # Can also use 'to'
        condition: Customer wants to place an order  # Can also use 'when'
      - target: customer_support
        condition: Customer has questions or needs help
      - target: end
        condition: Customer wants to leave
    examples:                 # Can also use 'eg'
      - context: "New customer enters"
        decision: "Greet warmly and ask how to help"
        visibility: "always"
```

<Note>
**Field Naming Flexibility**

NOMOS supports both compact (`id`, `desc`, `tools`, `paths`, `to`, `when`, `eg`) and descriptive (`step_id`, `description`, `available_tools`, `routes`, `target`, `condition`, `examples`) field names. You can use either convention or mix them in the same configuration file.
</Note>

### Step Components

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Identity">
    **Step ID**: Unique identifier for the step
    ```yaml
    step_id: take_coffee_order  # or 'id'
    ```
    This is how other steps reference this step in their routes.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Behavior">
    **Description**: What the agent should do in this step
    ```yaml
    description: |  # or 'desc'
      Take the customer's coffee order, including type, size, and any modifications.
      Use the menu tool to show available options if needed.
    ```
    This guides the LLM's behavior and reasoning.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Capabilities">
    **Available Tools**: Tools the agent can use in this step
    ```yaml
    available_tools:  # or 'tools'
      - get_menu_items
      - add_to_cart
      - calculate_price
    ```
    Only these tools are accessible during this step.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Flow Control">
    **Routes**: Where the agent can go next
    ```yaml
    routes:  # or 'paths'
      - target: confirm_order     # or 'to'
        condition: Order is complete and customer is satisfied  # or 'when'
      - target: modify_order
        condition: Customer wants to change something
    ```
    Defines possible transitions to other steps.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Advanced Step Features

### Step Examples

Provide examples to help the LLM understand expected behavior:

```yaml
- step_id: handle_complaint
  description: |
    Listen to customer complaints with empathy and work toward resolution.
  available_tools:
    - lookup_order_history
    - check_return_policy
    - issue_refund
  examples:
    - context: "Customer received damaged item"
      decision: "Apologize, lookup order, offer refund or replacement"
      visibility: "always"
    - context: "Customer angry about delivery delay"
      decision: "Acknowledge frustration, investigate delay, offer compensation"
      visibility: "when_relevant"
```

### Conditional Tool Access

Tools can be conditionally available based on context:

```yaml
- step_id: manager_escalation
  description: |
    Handle escalated issues that require manager authority.
  available_tools:
    - basic_customer_lookup
    - issue_special_discount  # Only available in this step
    - override_policy        # Manager-level tool
    - escalate_to_regional   # Final escalation option
  routes:
    - target: resolution_complete
      condition: Issue resolved with manager intervention
    - target: regional_escalation
      condition: Issue requires regional manager
```

### Overrides

Steps can override certain configurations for optimal usage:

```yaml
- step_id: code_generation
  description: |
    Generate code
  overrides:
    persona: You are a coding assistant.
    llm: coding
```

## Step Transitions and Routing

### Route Conditions

Route conditions should be clear and specific:

```yaml
routes:
  # Good: Specific conditions
  - target: payment_processing
    condition: Customer provided valid payment method and confirmed order total

  # Good: Business logic conditions
  - target: manager_approval
    condition: Order total exceeds $1000 and requires manager approval

  # Good: Error handling
  - target: retry_payment
    condition: Payment failed due to insufficient funds

  # Avoid: Vague conditions
  # - target: next_step
  #   condition: When ready
```

### Complex Routing Logic

Handle multiple routing scenarios:

```yaml
- step_id: order_validation
  description: |
    Validate order details and route based on validation results.
  available_tools:
    - validate_shipping_address
    - check_inventory_availability
    - verify_payment_method
  routes:
    - target: process_order
      condition: All validations pass and order can be processed immediately
    - target: address_correction
      condition: Shipping address needs correction
    - target: inventory_backorder
      condition: Some items are backordered but customer accepts delay
    - target: payment_issues
      condition: Payment method validation failed
    - target: order_cancellation
      condition: Critical validation failures that cannot be resolved
```

## Error Handling in Steps

### Graceful Error Recovery (Coming Soon)

```yaml
- step_id: external_api_integration
  description: |
    Integrate with external service, handling potential failures gracefully.
  available_tools:
    - call_external_api
    - fallback_local_data
    - notify_technical_team
  routes:
    - target: api_success_processing
      condition: External API call successful
    - target: fallback_processing
      condition: API unavailable but fallback data sufficient
    - target: service_unavailable
      condition: Neither API nor fallback available
  error_handling:
    max_retries: 3
    timeout: 30
    fallback_step: service_unavailable
```

## Step Performance and Optimization

### Efficient Tool Usage

```yaml
- step_id: optimized_lookup
  description: |
    Efficiently lookup customer information using cached data when possible.
  available_tools:
    - quick_customer_lookup   # Fast, cached lookup
    - detailed_customer_fetch # Slower, comprehensive lookup
    - update_customer_cache   # Update cache with new info
  routes:
    - target: serve_from_cache
      condition: Customer info found in cache and is recent
    - target: fetch_and_cache
      condition: Customer info not cached or outdated
```

## Testing Individual Steps

Steps can be tested independently:

```yaml
# tests.agent.yaml
unit:
  test_greeting_step:
    context:
      current_step_id: "greeting"
    input: "Hello, I'm looking for help with my order"
    expectation: "Greets customer and routes to support_request step"

  test_order_step_with_tools:
    context:
      current_step_id: "take_order"
    input: "I'd like a large latte with oat milk"
    expectation: "Uses menu tools and adds specific item to cart"

  test_error_handling:
    context:
      current_step_id: "payment_processing"
    input: "My card was declined"
    expectation: "Provides helpful error message and routes to payment_retry"
```

## Best Practices for Step Design

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle**

<Card title="One Job Per Step" icon="target">
Each step should have one clear purpose
</Card>

```yaml
# Good: Focused steps
- step_id: collect_shipping_address
- step_id: validate_shipping_address
- step_id: calculate_shipping_cost

# Avoid: Overloaded steps
# - step_id: handle_all_shipping_stuff
```

### 2. **Clear Transition Logic**

<Card title="Explicit Routing" icon="route">
Make transition conditions obvious and testable
</Card>

```yaml
routes:
  # Good: Clear conditions
  - target: payment_success
    condition: Payment processed successfully and confirmation email sent

  # Avoid: Ambiguous conditions
  # - target: next
  #   condition: When done
```

### 3. **Appropriate Tool Access**

<Card title="Minimal Tool Scope" icon="key">
Only provide tools that are needed for the step's purpose
</Card>

```yaml
- step_id: customer_greeting
  available_tools: []  # No tools needed for greeting

- step_id: lookup_order
  available_tools:
    - search_orders    # Only order search capability

- step_id: process_refund
  available_tools:
    - search_orders    # Need to find order
    - issue_refund     # Need to process refund
    # No other payment tools
```

### 4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**

<Card title="Expect the Unexpected" icon="shield">
Plan for failure scenarios and edge cases
</Card>

```yaml
- step_id: api_dependent_step
  routes:
    - target: success_path
      condition: API call successful
    - target: retry_path
      condition: API call failed but retryable
    - target: fallback_path
      condition: API unavailable but alternative exists
    - target: failure_path
      condition: No alternatives available
```

<Tip>
**Start Simple, Then Refine**

Begin with basic steps and gradually add complexity. It's easier to split a step that's doing too much than to combine steps that are too granular.
</Tip>
