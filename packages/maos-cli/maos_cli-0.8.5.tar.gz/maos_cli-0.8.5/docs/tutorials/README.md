## Tutorial Environment Setup

### Quick Setup (All Tutorials)
```bash
# Install MAOS
pip install maos

# Create tutorial workspace
mkdir -p ~/maos-tutorials
cd ~/maos-tutorials

# Initialize MAOS configuration
maos init

# Download tutorial resources
curl -L https://github.com/maos-team/tutorials/archive/main.zip -o tutorials.zip
unzip tutorials.zip
```

### Docker Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Pull MAOS tutorial environment
docker pull maos/tutorials:latest

# Run interactive tutorial environment
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 -p 3001:3001 maos/tutorials:latest

# Access tutorial materials at /tutorials inside container
```

### Cloud Environment (Optional)
Deploy a cloud-based tutorial environment for team training:

```bash
# Deploy to AWS using provided CloudFormation template
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name maos-tutorials \
  --template-url https://templates.maos.dev/tutorials/aws-environment.yaml \
  --parameters ParameterKey=InstanceType,ParameterValue=t3.large

# Get environment URL
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name maos-tutorials \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`TutorialURL`].OutputValue' \
  --output text
```
