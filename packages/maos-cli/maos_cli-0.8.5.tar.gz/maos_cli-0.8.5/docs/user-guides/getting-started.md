# MAOS Getting Started Guide

## Welcome to MAOS

The Multi-Agent Orchestration System (MAOS) enables true parallel execution of AI agents with shared state management and inter-agent communication. This guide will walk you through your first MAOS experience.

## What Makes MAOS Different

Unlike traditional "multi-agent" systems that simulate parallel processing, MAOS provides:

- **True Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents working simultaneously
- **Shared State Management**: Real-time coordination between agents
- **Automatic Checkpointing**: Never lose work due to failures
- **3-5x Performance Gains**: Measurable speedup for parallelizable tasks
- **Transparent Operation**: Clear visibility into what each agent is doing

## Your First MAOS Task

### Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Start MAOS** (from [Quick Start Guide](../deployment/quick-start.md)):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.maos.dev/quickstart | bash
   ```

2. **Submit your first task**:
   ```bash
   maos task submit "Research the top 3 programming languages in 2025 and their key advantages"
   ```

3. **Watch the magic happen**:
   ```bash
   maos monitor --follow
   ```

You'll see MAOS automatically:
- Decompose your task into subtasks
- Spawn specialized researcher agents  
- Execute research in parallel
- Coordinate results between agents
- Deliver a comprehensive final report

## Understanding MAOS Concepts

### Tasks and Orchestration

**Tasks** are the work you want MAOS to perform. When you submit a task, MAOS:

1. **Analyzes** the task complexity and requirements
2. **Decomposes** it into smaller, parallelizable subtasks
3. **Plans** the optimal execution strategy
4. **Spawns** the right agents with appropriate capabilities
5. **Coordinates** execution and combines results

### Agents and Capabilities

MAOS includes specialized **agent types**:

| Agent Type | Capabilities | Best For |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Researcher** | web_search, data_analysis, report_generation | Market research, competitive analysis |
| **Coder** | code_generation, testing, debugging | Software development, automation |
| **Analyst** | data_analysis, visualization, statistics | Data processing, insights generation |
| **Tester** | test_generation, test_execution, validation | Quality assurance, verification |
| **Coordinator** | task_coordination, consensus_building | Complex multi-step workflows |

### Shared State and Communication

Agents in MAOS can:
- **Share information** through a distributed memory system
- **Send messages** to coordinate work
- **Build consensus** when decisions are needed
- **Access each other's results** in real-time

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Tutorial 1: Simple Research Task

Let's start with a straightforward research task:

```bash
# Submit the task
maos task submit "Compare the environmental impact of solar vs wind energy"

# The command returns a task ID, for example: task_abc123
# Check the status
maos task show task_abc123

# Monitor progress in real-time
maos task progress task_abc123 --follow
```

**What you'll see:**
1. Task decomposition into research areas
2. Multiple researcher agents spawning
3. Parallel research execution
4. Results consolidation
5. Final comprehensive report

### Tutorial 2: Multi-Agent Development Task

Now let's try a more complex development task:

```bash
# Submit a coding task that benefits from parallel execution
maos task submit "Create a Python REST API for a todo application with authentication, CRUD operations, and unit tests" --type coding --max-agents 4
```

**Expected execution flow:**
1. **Planner agent**: Designs the API structure
2. **Coder agent 1**: Implements authentication
3. **Coder agent 2**: Implements CRUD operations  
4. **Tester agent**: Creates unit tests
5. **Coordinator**: Integrates all components

### Tutorial 3: Data Analysis Workflow

For data-intensive tasks:

```bash
# Submit an analysis task
maos task submit "Analyze customer satisfaction trends from the uploaded CSV data and create visualizations" --type analysis --priority HIGH
```

**Multi-agent approach:**
- **Analyst 1**: Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Analyst 2**: Statistical analysis and trend identification
- **Analyst 3**: Visualization generation
- **Coordinator**: Report compilation

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Batch Processing

Process multiple related tasks efficiently:

```bash
# Create a batch of related tasks
maos batch create --name "market-research-2025"

# Add tasks to the batch
maos batch add-task "market-research-2025" "Research AI market size in healthcare"
maos batch add-task "market-research-2025" "Research AI market size in finance"
maos batch add-task "market-research-2025" "Research AI market size in retail"

# Submit the entire batch
maos batch submit "market-research-2025"

# Monitor batch progress
maos batch status "market-research-2025"
```

### Workflow Templates

Create reusable workflow patterns:

```bash
# Save a successful task as a template
maos template create --name "api-development" --from-task task_abc123

# Use the template for new tasks
maos task submit-from-template "api-development" \
  --params '{"project_name": "inventory-system", "database": "postgresql"}'

# List available templates
maos template list
```

### Task Dependencies

Create complex workflows with dependencies:

```bash
# Submit parent task
RESEARCH_TASK=$(maos task submit "Research customer pain points in project management")

# Submit dependent task
maos task submit "Design solution architecture based on research findings" \
  --depends-on $RESEARCH_TASK \
  --type coding
```

## Optimization Tips

### Getting the Best Performance

1. **Clear Task Descriptions**: Be specific about what you want
   ```bash
   # Good
   maos task submit "Create a Python Flask REST API with JWT authentication, CRUD operations for tasks, and PostgreSQL database integration"
   
   # Less optimal  
   maos task submit "Make a web API"
   ```

2. **Appropriate Agent Limits**: Set reasonable agent counts
   ```bash
   # For complex tasks that benefit from parallelization
   maos task submit "..." --max-agents 8
   
   # For simple tasks
   maos task submit "..." --max-agents 2
   ```

3. **Use Task Types**: Help MAOS optimize agent selection
   ```bash
   maos task submit "..." --type research    # Uses researcher agents
   maos task submit "..." --type coding      # Uses coder agents
   maos task submit "..." --type analysis    # Uses analyst agents
   ```

### Monitoring Performance

Track your task performance:

```bash
# View performance metrics
maos metrics --timeframe 24h

# Compare parallel vs sequential execution
maos task compare task_abc123 --baseline sequential

# Get performance recommendations
maos analyze performance --task-type research
```

## Common Patterns and Examples

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Task Not Starting

**Symptoms**: Task stuck in QUEUED status

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check agent availability
maos agent list --status IDLE

# Check system resources
maos status --resources

# Increase agent limit if needed
maos config set system.max_agents 10
```

### Slow Task Execution

**Symptoms**: Tasks taking longer than expected

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Increase parallelization
maos task update task_abc123 --max-agents 6

# Check for bottlenecks
maos task analyze task_abc123 --performance

# Monitor resource usage
maos monitor --metric cpu,memory
```

### Poor Quality Results

**Symptoms**: Results don't meet expectations

**Solutions**:
1. **Improve task description**: Be more specific
2. **Set appropriate context**: Provide relevant background
3. **Use consensus**: Enable consensus for critical decisions
   ```bash
   maos task submit "..." --require-consensus true
   ```
