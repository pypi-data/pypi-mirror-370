## ADR-001: Layered Architecture Pattern

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Author**: System Architecture Team

### Context

MAOS requires a scalable, maintainable architecture that can handle complex multi-agent orchestration while maintaining clear separation of concerns and enabling independent development of different system components.

### Decision

Adopt a 4-layer architecture pattern:
1. **Orchestration Layer** - High-level planning and coordination
2. **Execution Layer** - Agent pool management and task execution  
3. **Communication Layer** - Inter-component messaging and consensus
4. **Storage Layer** - Persistent state and shared memory

### Rationale

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities
- **Scalability**: Layers can be scaled independently based on load
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer have minimal impact on others
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation
- **Team Organization**: Different teams can own different layers

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear architectural boundaries
- Independent scaling and deployment
- Easier testing and debugging
- Better code organization
- Reduced coupling between components

**Negative:**
- Additional network hops between layers
- More complex deployment coordination
- Potential performance overhead from layer abstractions
- Need for careful API design between layers

### Alternatives Considered

- **Monolithic Architecture**: Rejected due to scalability concerns
- **Microservices**: Too complex for initial implementation
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Considered but layered approach chosen for clarity

## ADR-005: JWT for Authentication and Authorization

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-28  
**Author**: Security Team

### Context

MAOS requires a stateless authentication mechanism that can scale across multiple service instances and support fine-grained authorization.

### Decision

Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication with role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) for authorization.

### Rationale

- **Stateless**: No server-side session storage required
- **Scalable**: Tokens can be validated without database lookups
- **Standard**: Industry standard with good library support
- **Flexible**: Can include custom claims for authorization
- **Cross-Service**: Works across different service boundaries
- **Offline Validation**: Services can validate tokens independently

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Stateless authentication scales horizontally
- Reduced database load for token validation
- Standard approach with good tooling
- Fine-grained authorization capabilities
- Cross-service authentication without network calls

**Negative:**
- Token revocation complexity
- Token size can become large with many claims
- Need secure key management for signing
- Cannot easily invalidate compromised tokens

### Alternatives Considered

**Date**: 2024-02-12  
**Author**: API Team

### Context

MAOS internal services need efficient, type-safe communication with support for streaming, load balancing, and service mesh integration.

### Decision

Use gRPC for internal service-to-service communication and REST APIs for external client communication.

### Rationale

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Better performance than REST for internal communication
- Strong typing reduces integration errors
- Excellent tooling and code generation
- Natural fit with service mesh architectures
- Streaming support for real-time communication

**Negative:**
