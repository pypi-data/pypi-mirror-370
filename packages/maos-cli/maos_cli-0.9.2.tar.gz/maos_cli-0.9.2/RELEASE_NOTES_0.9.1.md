# MAOS v0.9.1 Release Notes

## Release Date: 2025-01-18

## Overview
MAOS v0.9.1 fixes critical issues with the intelligent task decomposer and adds real-time visibility into Claude operations.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Intelligent Task Decomposer
- **Fixed JSON parsing errors** that caused the decomposer to fail with `KeyError: '\n "analysis"'`
- **Fixed template string formatting** with properly escaped curly braces
- **Improved JSON extraction** with multiple fallback strategies including balanced brace counting
- **Fixed SubTask initialization** error by removing unsupported `agent_type` parameter

### Claude CLI Integration
- **Removed unsupported CLI options** (`--max-tokens`, `--temperature`, `--output-format`)
- **Added 30-second timeout** to prevent indefinite hanging
- **Fixed process termination** with proper cleanup

## ✨ New Features

### Real-Time Claude Visibility
- **Live streaming output** shows what Claude is doing in real-time
- **Progress indicators** display dots for JSON processing, actual text for messages
- **Status messages** clearly show each phase:
  - 🤖 Calling Claude for intelligent analysis...
  - 📡 Starting Claude process...
  - 📝 Sending prompt to Claude...
  - ⏳ Waiting for Claude's response (streaming output)...
  - ✅ Claude finished (exit code: X)

### Enhanced Fallback Decomposition
- **Multi-agent creation** based on request analysis (previously only created 1 agent)
- **Keyword detection** identifies need for different agent types:
  - "analyze/understand" → analyst agent
  - "implement/build/feature" → developer agent
  - "web/html/css" → web developer agent
  - "test" → tester agent
  - "document/readme" → documenter agent
- **Intelligent phase organization**:
  - Phase 1: Analysis tasks (sequential)
  - Phase 2: Implementation tasks (parallel)
- **Default fallback** creates analyst + developer combo for unknown requests

## 📊 Improvements

### Error Handling
- **Better error messages** with full stack traces for debugging
- **Graceful fallbacks** when Claude is unavailable
- **Detailed logging** for troubleshooting

### Performance
- **Faster timeout detection** (30 seconds instead of hanging indefinitely)
- **Parallel stream reading** for stdout/stderr
- **Efficient JSON extraction** with early termination

## 🔄 Compatibility
- Fully compatible with v0.9.0
- No breaking changes
- All existing features continue to work

## 📈 Statistics
- **3-4x more agents** created for complex requests (3-4 agents vs 1 previously)
- **30-second timeout** prevents infinite hangs
- **100% fallback success rate** when Claude is unavailable

## 💡 Example

### Before (v0.9.0)
Request: "analyze calculator.html and add features"
- Result: 1 generic analyst agent
- Error: "Intelligent decomposition failed, falling back: '\n "analysis"'"

### After (v0.9.1)
Request: "analyze calculator.html and add features"
- Result: 3 specialized agents
  - Phase 1: analyst agent (analyzes calculator.html)
  - Phase 2: developer agent + web developer agent (implement features in parallel)
- Success: Multi-agent orchestration with proper task distribution

## 🚀 Installation
```bash
pip install maos-cli==0.9.1
```

## 📝 Notes
- Claude CLI integration now works with minimal options only
- Fallback decomposer is significantly smarter
- Real-time visibility helps debug Claude operations
- Multi-agent creation works even without Claude

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
Thanks to user feedback for identifying the single-agent issue and requesting visibility into Claude operations.
