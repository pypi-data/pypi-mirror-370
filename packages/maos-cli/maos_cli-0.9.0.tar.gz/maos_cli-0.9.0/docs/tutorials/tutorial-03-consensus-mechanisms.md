# Tutorial 3: Advanced Consensus Mechanisms

**Duration:** 60-75 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Prerequisites:** Completion of Tutorials 1-2, understanding of distributed systems concepts

## Overview

In this advanced tutorial, you'll explore MAOS's sophisticated consensus mechanisms that enable distributed decision-making and coordination among agents. You'll learn how agents reach agreement, resolve conflicts, and maintain consistency in complex distributed environments.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Understand and implement different consensus algorithms
- Design fault-tolerant distributed workflows
- Handle Byzantine failures and malicious agents
- Optimize consensus performance for different scenarios
- Create custom consensus policies for specialized domains

## Learning Objectives

1. **Consensus Theory**: Understand fundamental distributed consensus concepts
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Work with different consensus algorithms in MAOS
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Design systems resilient to various failure modes
4. **Performance Optimization**: Balance consistency, availability, and performance
5. **Custom Policies**: Create domain-specific consensus mechanisms

## Part 1: Consensus Fundamentals

### Understanding Distributed Consensus

In MAOS, agents often need to make collective decisions:
- Which solution approach to take
- How to resolve conflicting information
- When to finalize results
- How to handle failed agents

### Consensus Algorithms in MAOS

MAOS implements several consensus algorithms:

| Algorithm | Best For | Fault Tolerance | Performance |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Simple Majority** | Quick decisions, trusted agents | f < n/2 | High |
| **Supermajority** | Critical decisions | f < n/3 | Medium |
| **Byzantine Fault Tolerant** | Untrusted environments | f < n/3 Byzantine | Low |
| **Weighted Voting** | Expert-based decisions | Varies | Medium |
| **RAFT** | Leader-based coordination | f < n/2 crash failures | High |

### Exercise 1: Basic Consensus Configuration

Configure MAOS for consensus-driven workflows:

```bash
# Configure consensus system
cat > ~/.maos/consensus-config.yml << 'EOF'
consensus:
  default_algorithm: "simple_majority"
  voting_timeout: 60
  byzantine_tolerance: false
  
  algorithms:
    simple_majority:
      threshold: 0.5
      min_participants: 2
      
    supermajority:
      threshold: 0.67
      min_participants: 3
      
    byzantine_tolerant:
      threshold: 0.67
      min_participants: 4
      byzantine_detection: true
      
    weighted_voting:
      threshold: 0.6
      expert_weight: 2.0
      regular_weight: 1.0

agent_weights:
  researcher: 1.5    # Higher weight for research decisions
  analyst: 1.5       # Higher weight for analysis decisions  
  coder: 1.0         # Standard weight
  tester: 2.0        # Higher weight for quality decisions
  coordinator: 1.2   # Slightly higher coordination weight
EOF

# Apply consensus configuration
maos config merge ~/.maos/consensus-config.yml
```

## Part 2: Simple Majority Consensus

### Exercise 2: Basic Majority Voting

Create a task requiring simple consensus:

```bash
# Submit task requiring agent consensus on approach
CONSENSUS_TASK=$(maos task submit "Choose the best database technology for a high-traffic e-commerce platform: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or DynamoDB. Agents must reach consensus on the recommendation." --require-consensus --consensus-algorithm simple_majority --max-agents 5 --format json | jq -r '.task_id')

echo "Consensus task: $CONSENSUS_TASK"

# Monitor consensus process
maos consensus monitor $CONSENSUS_TASK --detailed --follow
```

**What You'll Observe:**
- Agents researching each database option
- Individual agent preferences and reasoning
- Voting process and discussion
- Final consensus outcome

### Exercise 3: Monitoring Consensus Details

Examine the consensus process in detail:

```bash
# View consensus timeline
maos consensus show $CONSENSUS_TASK --timeline

# See individual agent votes and reasoning
maos consensus show $CONSENSUS_TASK --votes --reasoning

# Check consensus statistics
maos consensus stats $CONSENSUS_TASK
```

**Consensus Timeline Example:**
```
12:00:00 - Task started, 5 agents assigned
12:02:30 - Agent voting phase begins
12:02:35 - researcher_001 votes: PostgreSQL (reason: ACID compliance)
12:02:40 - analyst_001 votes: PostgreSQL (reason: analytics capabilities)
12:02:45 - coder_001 votes: MongoDB (reason: development flexibility)
12:02:50 - coder_002 votes: PostgreSQL (reason: reliability)
12:02:55 - analyst_002 votes: DynamoDB (reason: scalability)
12:03:00 - Simple majority reached: PostgreSQL (3/5 votes)
12:03:05 - Consensus achieved, finalizing recommendation
```

## Part 3: Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus

### Understanding Byzantine Failures

Byzantine failures occur when agents:
- Provide incorrect information intentionally
- Send conflicting messages to different agents
- Fail to respond or respond unpredictably
- Are compromised by external actors

### Exercise 4: Byzantine Fault Tolerant Setup

Configure BFT consensus for untrusted environments:

```bash
# Enable Byzantine fault tolerance
maos config set consensus.default_algorithm "byzantine_tolerant"
maos config set consensus.byzantine_tolerance true
maos config set consensus.malicious_detection true

# Submit task with BFT consensus
BFT_TASK=$(maos task submit "Analyze financial data and recommend investment strategy. Some agents may provide unreliable information." --require-consensus --consensus-algorithm byzantine_tolerant --max-agents 7 --format json | jq -r '.task_id')

# Monitor BFT consensus
maos consensus monitor $BFT_TASK --byzantine-detection --follow
```

### Exercise 5: Simulating Byzantine Failures

Test system resilience with simulated failures:

```bash
# Start Byzantine failure simulation
maos debug byzantine-simulation start \
  --task $BFT_TASK \
  --failure-rate 0.2 \
  --failure-types "conflicting_votes,delayed_responses,false_information"

# Monitor how system handles Byzantine agents
maos consensus monitor $BFT_TASK --failure-detection --follow

# Stop simulation
maos debug byzantine-simulation stop
```

**BFT Consensus Process:**
1. **Information Gathering**: Agents collect data independently
2. **Cross-Validation**: Agents verify information with peers
3. **Suspicious Behavior Detection**: System identifies inconsistent agents
4. **Vote Collection**: Byzantine-tolerant voting protocol
5. **Consensus Achievement**: Despite up to f < n/3 Byzantine agents

## Part 4: Weighted Voting Systems

### Exercise 6: Expert-Weighted Consensus

Create consensus systems that value expert opinions:

```bash
# Configure expert weighting
cat > expert-weights.yml << 'EOF'
agent_expertise:
  security_expert:
    weight: 3.0
    domains: ["security", "authentication", "encryption"]
    
  performance_expert:
    weight: 2.5
    domains: ["performance", "scalability", "optimization"]
    
  domain_expert:
    weight: 2.0
    domains: ["business_logic", "domain_modeling"]
    
  general_developer:
    weight: 1.0
    domains: ["general_development"]
EOF

# Apply expert configuration
maos config merge expert-weights.yml

# Submit task requiring expert consensus
EXPERT_TASK=$(maos task submit "Design security architecture for a healthcare application handling PHI data. Experts in security, compliance, and healthcare must reach consensus." --require-consensus --consensus-algorithm weighted_voting --max-agents 6 --expert-weighting true --format json | jq -r '.task_id')

# Monitor expert-weighted consensus
maos consensus monitor $EXPERT_TASK --show-weights --expert-reasoning
```

### Exercise 7: Dynamic Weight Adjustment

Implement consensus with dynamic weight adjustment:

```bash
# Submit task with performance-based weight adjustment
DYNAMIC_TASK=$(maos task submit "Solve a complex optimization problem requiring mathematical expertise. Agent weights should adjust based on solution quality." --require-consensus --consensus-algorithm weighted_voting --dynamic-weights true --max-agents 5 --format json | jq -r '.task_id')

# Watch weights adjust based on performance
maos consensus monitor $DYNAMIC_TASK --weight-evolution --follow
```

**Dynamic Weighting Process:**
- Initial equal weights for all agents
- Weights increase for agents providing high-quality contributions
- Weights decrease for agents with poor performance
- Final consensus weighted by demonstrated expertise

## Part 5: RAFT Consensus for Leader Election

### Exercise 8: Leader-Based Coordination

Implement RAFT consensus for coordinated workflows:

```bash
# Configure RAFT consensus
maos config set consensus.raft.enabled true
maos config set consensus.raft.leader_timeout 5000
maos config set consensus.raft.election_timeout_min 1000
maos config set consensus.raft.election_timeout_max 2000

# Submit task requiring leader coordination
RAFT_TASK=$(maos task submit "Coordinate a complex multi-phase software deployment across multiple environments. Requires strong consistency and leader-based coordination." --require-consensus --consensus-algorithm raft --max-agents 5 --format json | jq -r '.task_id')

# Monitor RAFT leader election and log replication
maos consensus monitor $RAFT_TASK --raft-details --follow
```

### Exercise 9: RAFT Failure Recovery

Test RAFT's leader failure recovery:

```bash
# Start RAFT consensus monitoring
maos consensus monitor $RAFT_TASK --raft-leader --follow &

# Wait for leader election
sleep 30

# Simulate leader failure
LEADER_ID=$(maos consensus show $RAFT_TASK --raft-leader --format json | jq -r '.current_leader')
maos debug simulate-failure --agent $LEADER_ID --failure-type crash --duration 60s

# Watch new leader election
maos consensus monitor $RAFT_TASK --raft-election --follow
```

**RAFT Recovery Process:**
1. **Leader Failure Detection**: Followers detect leader timeout
2. **Candidate Election**: Followers become candidates
3. **Vote Collection**: Candidates request votes from peers
4. **New Leader Election**: Candidate with majority becomes leader
5. **Log Synchronization**: New leader synchronizes state

## Part 6: Custom Consensus Policies

### Exercise 10: Domain-Specific Consensus

Create custom consensus for specialized domains:

```bash
# Define custom medical consensus policy
cat > medical-consensus-policy.py << 'EOF'
from maos.consensus import ConsensusPolicy, VotingStrategy
from typing import Dict, List, Any

class MedicalConsensusPolicy(ConsensusPolicy):
    def __init__(self):

        # Find decision with highest weighted support
        best_decision = max(decision_weights.keys(), 
                          key=lambda x: decision_weights[x])
        consensus_strength = decision_weights[best_decision] / total_weight

### Exercise 11: Financial Risk Consensus

Create consensus for financial decision-making:

```bash
# Define financial risk consensus
cat > financial-consensus-policy.py << 'EOF'
from maos.consensus import ConsensusPolicy
from typing import Dict, List, Any
import numpy as np

  --agent-counts "3,5,7,9" \
  --iterations 10 \
  --output consensus_benchmark.json

# Analyze results
maos consensus analyze-benchmark consensus_benchmark.json --detailed
```

Byzantine Tolerant (n=7):
- Consensus Time: 2.4s ± 0.8s
- Success Rate: 99.2%
- Byzantine Tolerance: f < n/3
- Throughput: 25 decisions/min

Weighted Voting (n=5):
- Consensus Time: 1.5s ± 0.4s
- Success Rate: 99.1% 
- Byzantine Tolerance: Varies
- Throughput: 40 decisions/min

RAFT (n=5):
- Consensus Time: 0.6s ± 0.1s
- Success Rate: 99.8%
- Byzantine Tolerance: None (crash only)
- Throughput: 100 decisions/min
```

### Exercise 13: Consensus Optimization

Optimize consensus for different scenarios:

```bash
# Optimize for speed (low-stakes decisions)
maos consensus optimize --target speed \
  --task-type "routine_decisions" \
  --recommended-algorithm simple_majority \
  --timeout-aggressive

# Optimize for reliability (critical decisions)
maos consensus optimize --target reliability \
  --task-type "critical_decisions" \
  --recommended-algorithm byzantine_tolerant \
  --redundancy-high

# Optimize for expertise (complex technical decisions)
maos consensus optimize --target expertise \
  --task-type "technical_decisions" \
  --recommended-algorithm weighted_voting \
  --expert-weighting-enabled
```

## Part 8: Advanced Consensus Scenarios

### Exercise 14: Multi-Stage Consensus

Implement consensus for multi-stage decision processes:

```bash
# Create multi-stage consensus workflow
MULTISTAGE_CONSENSUS=$(cat << 'EOF'
{
  "workflow_name": "product_development_consensus",
  "stages": [
    {
      "stage": "concept_validation",
      "consensus_algorithm": "simple_majority",
      "threshold": 0.6,
      "max_agents": 5,
      "description": "Validate product concept and market fit"
    },
    {
      "stage": "technical_feasibility", 
      "consensus_algorithm": "weighted_voting",
      "expert_domains": ["engineering", "architecture"],
      "threshold": 0.7,
      "depends_on": ["concept_validation"],
      "description": "Assess technical feasibility and architecture decisions"
    },
    {
      "stage": "resource_allocation",
      "consensus_algorithm": "supermajority", 
      "threshold": 0.75,
      "depends_on": ["technical_feasibility"],
      "description": "Decide on resource allocation and timeline"
    },
    {
      "stage": "final_approval",
      "consensus_algorithm": "byzantine_tolerant",
      "threshold": 0.8,
      "depends_on": ["resource_allocation"],
      "description": "Final go/no-go decision with high confidence"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
)

echo "$MULTISTAGE_CONSENSUS" | maos consensus workflow submit --format json
```

### Exercise 15: Adaptive Consensus

Implement consensus that adapts based on context:

```bash
# Submit task with adaptive consensus
ADAPTIVE_TASK=$(maos task submit "Make strategic business decision about entering new market. Consensus requirements should adapt based on risk level and market conditions discovered during analysis." --require-consensus --consensus-algorithm adaptive --max-agents 6 --format json | jq -r '.task_id')

# Monitor adaptive consensus behavior
maos consensus monitor $ADAPTIVE_TASK --adaptive-behavior --follow
```

**Adaptive Consensus Logic:**
- **Low Risk Discovery**: Switch to simple majority (fast decision)
- **Medium Risk Discovery**: Use weighted voting (expert input)
- **High Risk Discovery**: Require Byzantine-tolerant supermajority
- **Critical Risk Discovery**: Escalate to human oversight

## Part 9: Consensus in Failure Scenarios

### Exercise 16: Network Partition Tolerance

Test consensus behavior during network partitions:

```bash
# Start consensus task
PARTITION_TASK=$(maos task submit "Coordinate distributed system configuration changes across multiple data centers during potential network issues." --require-consensus --consensus-algorithm raft --max-agents 7 --format json | jq -r '.task_id')

# Simulate network partition
maos debug network-partition \
  --split-ratio 0.4 \
  --duration 120s \
  --task $PARTITION_TASK

# Monitor consensus behavior during partition
maos consensus monitor $PARTITION_TASK --partition-behavior --follow
```

### Exercise 17: Agent Failure Recovery

Test consensus recovery from agent failures:

```bash
# Start consensus with failure tolerance
FAILURE_TASK=$(maos task submit "Critical system configuration requiring consensus despite potential agent failures." --require-consensus --consensus-algorithm byzantine_tolerant --max-agents 9 --failure-tolerance high --format json | jq -r '.task_id')

# Simulate cascading failures
maos debug simulate-cascading-failures \
  --initial-failure-rate 0.1 \
  --failure-propagation 0.3 \
  --recovery-time 30s \
  --task $FAILURE_TASK

# Monitor consensus resilience
maos consensus monitor $FAILURE_TASK --failure-recovery --follow
```

## Part 10: Production Consensus Patterns

### Exercise 18: Enterprise Consensus Configuration

Configure consensus for enterprise production use:

```bash
# Enterprise consensus configuration
cat > enterprise-consensus.yml << 'EOF'
consensus:
  production_mode: true
  
  # Default policies by decision type
  decision_policies:
    routine:
      algorithm: "simple_majority"
      threshold: 0.6
      timeout: 30s
      
    important:
      algorithm: "supermajority" 
      threshold: 0.67
      timeout: 120s

### Exercise 19: Consensus Monitoring Dashboard

Set up comprehensive consensus monitoring:

```bash
# Start consensus monitoring dashboard
maos consensus dashboard start \
  --port 3002 \
  --real-time-updates \
  --consensus-visualization \
  --failure-detection \
  --performance-metrics

# Configure alerts
maos consensus alerts configure \
  --slow-consensus-alert 120s \
  --failure-rate-alert 0.1 \
  --byzantine-detection-alert \
  --notification-channels "slack,email"

echo "Consensus dashboard available at: http://localhost:3002"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Consensus Issues

**Consensus never reached:**
```bash
# Check voting participation
maos consensus show $TASK_ID --participation

# Verify network connectivity
maos consensus health --connectivity-test

# Examine vote conflicts
maos consensus show $TASK_ID --vote-conflicts
```

**Byzantine agents detected:**
```bash
# Identify suspicious agents
maos consensus show $TASK_ID --byzantine-detection

# Review agent behavior patterns  
maos consensus analyze $TASK_ID --agent-behavior

# Apply countermeasures
maos consensus isolate-byzantine --task $TASK_ID
```

**Poor consensus performance:**
```bash
# Analyze consensus bottlenecks
maos consensus analyze $TASK_ID --performance

# Optimize algorithm selection
maos consensus optimize --task $TASK_ID --target speed

# Tune consensus parameters
maos consensus tune --algorithm $ALGORITHM --optimize-for throughput
```
