---

**Aurite Agents** is a powerful, configuration-driven framework designed for building and orchestrating sophisticated AI agents. It enables agents to interact with a variety of external tools, prompts, and resources through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing them to perform complex, multi-step tasks.

Whether you're creating advanced AI assistants, automating processes, or experimenting with agentic workflows, Aurite provides the modular building blocks and robust infrastructure you need.

## Key Features

-   **Hierarchical Configuration:** Organize your components with a powerful **Workspace -> Project** system that allows for shared configurations and clear separation of concerns.
-   **Declarative Components:** Define agents, LLMs, tools, and workflows in simple JSON or YAML files.
-   **Interactive CLI & TUIs:** A rich command-line interface (`aurite`) and two built-in Textual User Interfaces (TUIs) for interactive chat and configuration editing.
-   **Extensible Tooling:** Connect to any tool or service using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, with built-in support for local and remote servers.
-   **Flexible Orchestration:** Chain agents together in `linear_workflows` for sequential tasks or write custom Python logic in `custom_workflows` for complex orchestration.
-   **REST API:** A comprehensive FastAPI server that exposes all framework functionality for programmatic access and UI development.

## Getting Started

The best way to start with Aurite is by installing the Python package and using the interactive initializer.

1.  **Install the package:**
    ```bash
    pip install aurite
    ```
2.  **Initialize your first project:**
    ```bash
    aurite init
    ```
    This command will launch an interactive wizard to set up your workspace and first project.

For a complete walkthrough, see the [**Package Installation Guide**](docs/getting-started/installation_guides/package_installation_guide.md).

Developers who wish to contribute to the framework should follow the [**Repository Installation Guide**](docs/getting-started/installation_guides/repository_installation_guide.md).

## Core Concepts

### 1. Workspaces & Projects

Aurite uses a hierarchical system to organize your work, defined by a special `.aurite` file.

-   **Workspace:** A top-level container that can manage multiple projects and share common configurations (e.g., a standard set of LLMs).
-   **Project:** A self-contained directory holding all the configurations for a specific application or task.

This structure allows for clean separation and promotes reusable components. Learn more in the [**Projects and Workspaces Guide**](docs/config/projects_and_workspaces.md).

### 2. Components

Your application is built by defining and combining different types of components in `.json` or `.yaml` files.

-   **[Agents](docs/config/agent.md):** The core actors, powered by an LLM and capable of using tools.
-   **[LLMs](docs/config/llm.md):** Configurations for different language models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3).
-   **[MCP Servers](docs/config/mcp_server.md):** Connections to external tools and resources.
-   **[Linear Workflows](docs/config/linear_workflow.md):** A sequence of agents to be executed in order.
-   **[Custom Workflows](docs/config/custom_workflow.md):** Complex orchestration logic defined in your own Python code.

### 3. Interfaces

Aurite provides multiple ways to interact with the framework:

-   [**Web Interface (Aurite Studio)**](frontend/packages/aurite-studio/): Modern React web application for visual agent management, workflow design, and real-time execution monitoring.
-   [**TypeScript/JavaScript API**](frontend/packages/api-client/): Production-ready API client for building web applications and integrations with full type safety and streaming support.
-   [**Command-Line Interface (CLI)**](docs/usage/cli_reference.md): The primary tool for managing your projects. Use it to `init`, `list`, `show`, `run`, and `edit` your components.
-   [**Textual User Interfaces (TUIs)**](docs/usage/tui_guide.md): Rich, in-terminal applications for interactive chat with agents (`aurite run <agent_name>`) and live configuration editing (`aurite edit`).
-   [**REST API**](docs/usage/api_reference.md): A complete FastAPI server (`aurite api`) that exposes all framework functionality for UIs and programmatic control.

## Frontend Framework

Aurite includes a comprehensive **TypeScript/JavaScript frontend ecosystem** that provides both programmatic access and visual interfaces for the Python framework.

### Frontend Packages

-   **[@aurite/api-client](frontend/packages/api-client/)** - Production-ready TypeScript client library with full type safety, retry logic, and streaming support for all framework APIs.
-   **[@aurite/aurite-studio](frontend/packages/aurite-studio/)** - Modern React web interface providing visual management and execution of agents, workflows, and configurations.

### Key Frontend Features

-   🔒 **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
-   🔄 **Real-time Streaming**: Live agent responses and execution monitoring
-   🎨 **Modern UI**: Intuitive React interface with responsive design
-   🧪 **Production Ready**: Extensive testing, error handling, and deployment tools
-   📖 **Rich Examples**: Comprehensive examples and integration guides

For complete setup instructions, examples, and API documentation, see the [**Frontend Documentation**](frontend/README.md).

## Architecture Overview

The framework is built on a layered architecture that separates concerns from the user-facing entrypoints down to the external tool connections.
