Quart-DB is a Quart extension that provides managed connection(s) to
postgresql or sqlite database(s).

Quickstart
----------

Quart-DB is used by associating it with an app and a DB (via a URL)
and then utilising the ``g.connection`` connection,

.. code-block:: python

   from quart import g, Quart, websocket
   from quart_db import QuartDB

   app = Quart(__name__)
   db = QuartDB(app, url="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db_name")

   @app.get("/<int:id>")
   async def get_count(id: int):
       result = await g.connection.fetch_val(
           "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl WHERE id = :id",
           {"id": id},
       )
       return {"count": result}

   @app.post("/")
   async def set_with_transaction():
       async with g.connection.transaction():
           await db.execute("UPDATE tbl SET done = :done", {"done": True})
           ...
       return {}

   @app.get("/explicit")
   async def explicit_usage():
        async with db.connection() as connection:
            ...
