# YT-Concat

This is a powerful command-line tool that automates the process of finding specific content within a YouTube channel. It works by searching through the captions of a channel's videos for a given keyword, extracting the relevant video segments, and merging them into a single, cohesive video.

Whether you're compiling highlights from a long lecture series, creating a supercut of a catchphrase, or just summarizing a channel's content, this tool helps you efficiently pinpoint and combine the moments that matter.
