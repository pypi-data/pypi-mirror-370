## Quickstart Examples

The following notebooks demonstrate the

### 1. [`quickstart.ipynb`](quickstart.ipynb)

- Using GAICo's `Experiment` module to provide a simple, quickstart workflow.

### 2. [`example-1.ipynb`](example-1.ipynb): Multiple Models, Single Metric

- Evaluating multiple models (LLMs, Google, and Custom) using a single metric with `<metric>.calculate()` method.

### 3. [`example-2.ipynb`](example-2.ipynb): Single Model, Multiple Metric

- Evaluating a single model on multiple metrics with their `<metric>.calculate()` methods.

### 4. [`example-structured_data.ipynb`](example-structured_data.ipynb): Time-Series and Automated Planning

- A comparison of 'usual' text-based metrics with special metrics for time series and automated planning.

### 5. [`example-audio.ipynb`](example-audio.ipynb): Audio Evaluation with Specialized Metrics

- Evaluating AI-generated TTS audio using specialized audio metrics and highlighting why text-based metrics are unsuitable for audio tasks.

### 6. [`example-image.ipynb`](example-image.ipynb): Image Evaluation with Specialized Metrics

- Evaluating AI-generated images using specialized image metrics.

### 7. [`case_study.ipynb`](case_study.ipynb): Travel Assistant AI System Evaluation using GAICo

- Evaluating composite AI travel assistant system "pipelines" using GAICo, comprising an orchestrator LLM and specialist image and audio generation models.

## Intermediate Examples

The `intermediate-examples` directory contains notebooks that illustrate fundamental concepts and workflows in GAICo in various domains. These examples are designed for users who want to understand the GAICo's functionalities in various domains.

### 1. [`example-timeseries.ipynb`](intermediate-examples/example-timeseries.ipynb): Time Series Analysis

- Evaluation and perturbation of time series using GAICo's time series specific metrics.

### 2. [`example-planning.ipynb`](intermediate-examples/example-planning.ipynb): Automated Planning Analysis

- Evaluation of various travel plans using GAICo's planning specific metrics.

### 3. [`example-finance.ipynb`](intermediate-examples/example-finance.ipynb): Finance Dataset Analysis

- Evaluating models on various questions from the finance domain by iterating on the dataset with the `Experiment` class.

### 4. [`example-recipes.ipynb`](intermediate-examples/example-recipes.ipynb): Recipe Dataset Analysis

- Evaluating models on various questions from the recipe domain by iterating on the dataset with the `Experiment` class. Further uses parallelization of the comparisons using `joblib`.

### 5. [`example-election.ipynb`](intermediate-examples/example-election.ipynb): Election Dataset Analysis

- Evaluating models on various questions from the election domain by using the `calculate()` metric method.

### 6. [`DeepSeek-example.ipynb`](intermediate-examples/example-DeepSeek.ipynb): Testing _DeepSeek R1_

- The aim for this notebook was to aid with evaluating DeepSeek R1 for [AI4Society's Point of View (POV)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ErR1xT7ftvmHiUyYrdUbjyd4qCK_FxKX/view?usp=sharing).
- **Note**: All results remove the `<think>` tags for the DeepSeek models.

### 7. [`example-audio_data.ipynb`](intermediate-examples/example-audio_data.ipynb): Advanced Audio Analysis & Multi-format Processing

- Demonstrates audio evaluation across different formats (MP3/WAV) and format-independent processing capabilities.
- Provides interpretation frameworks for both fidelity tasks (TTS) and creative generation (music), with detailed quality analysis.

## Advanced Examples

The `advanced-examples` directory contains advances notebooks showcasing more complex use cases and metrics. These examples are intended for users who are already familiar with the basics of GAICo. Please refer to the README.md file in that directory for details. A quick description:

### 1. [`example-llm_faq.ipynb`](advanced-examples/example-llm_faq.ipynb): LLM FAQ Analysis

- Comparison of various LLM responses (Phi, Mixtral, etc.) on FAQ dataset from USC.

### 2. [`example-threshold.ipynb`](advanced-examples/example-threshold.ipynb): Thresholds

- Exploration of default and custom thresholding techniques for LLM responses.

### 3. [`example-viz.ipynb`](advanced-examples/example-viz.ipynb): Visualizations

- Hands-on visualizations for LLM results.
