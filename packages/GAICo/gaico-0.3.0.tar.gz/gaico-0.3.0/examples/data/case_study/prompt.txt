You are a sophisticated AI Travel Assistant Orchestrator. Your task is to generate a travel plan based on the user's request.

Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting like ```json.

The user's request is: "A 3-day Paris trip for a first-time visitor on a moderate budget."

Please generate a JSON object with a root key "trip_plan" which is an array of objects, one for each day. Each daily object must contain the following keys:
- "day": (Integer) The day number.
- "day_plan_text": (String) A descriptive, paragraph-long summary of the day's activities.
- "day_plan_sequence": (String) A comma-separated sequence of actions representing the plan, e.g., "visit(location), eat(restaurant), see(landmark)".
- "day_budget_euros": (Number) An estimated budget in Euros for the day.
- "image_prompt": (String) A detailed, artistic, and descriptive prompt for an image generation model, capturing the essence of the day's main landmark.
- "audio_script": (String) A concise, engaging 15-second summary of the day's activities, written as a script for a text-to-speech model.

Here is an example of the required structure for a single day object:
{
  "day": 1,
  "day_plan_text": "Your first day in Paris begins with an artistic immersion at the Louvre Museum, home to masterpieces like the Mona Lisa. After exploring its vast collection, enjoy a leisurely stroll through the adjacent Tuileries Garden. The day concludes with a visit to the iconic Eiffel Tower, where you can see the city sparkle at night.",
  "day_plan_sequence": "visit(Louvre Museum), walk(Tuileries Garden), view(Eiffel Tower at night)",
  "day_budget_euros": 150,
  "image_prompt": "An elegant, cinematic, wide-angle photo of the Louvre Museum at dusk. The glass pyramid is illuminated from within, casting a warm, golden glow. The sky is a deep twilight blue, and the classic Parisian architecture of the palace is visible in the background. The courtyard is wet, reflecting the lights. Style of a modern travel magazine cover.",
  "audio_script": "Welcome to Paris! Today, we'll marvel at the Mona Lisa in the Louvre, wander through the beautiful Tuileries Garden, and watch the Eiffel Tower light up the night sky. An unforgettable start!"
}

Now, generate the complete JSON object for the 3-day trip.
