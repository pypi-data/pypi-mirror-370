Connection management functionality for real-time client.

Author: @TexasCoding
Date: 2025-08-02

Overview:
    Provides connection management functionality for the ProjectX real-time client,
    including SignalR hub setup, connection establishment, reconnection handling,
    and JWT token refresh capabilities.

Key Features:
    - Dual-hub SignalR connection setup and management
    - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
    - JWT token authentication and refresh handling
    - Connection health monitoring and error handling
    - Thread-safe operations with proper lock management
    - Comprehensive connection statistics and health tracking

Connection Management Capabilities:
    - SignalR hub setup with ProjectX Gateway configuration
    - Connection establishment and health monitoring
    - Automatic reconnection with configurable intervals
    - JWT token refresh and reconnection handling
    - Connection event handling and error processing
    - Statistics tracking and health reporting

Example Usage:
    The functionality of this mixin is consumed through a `ProjectXRealtimeClient` instance.
    For most use cases, this is handled automatically by the `TradingSuite`.

    ```python
    # The following demonstrates the low-level connection lifecycle managed by this mixin.
    # Note: In a typical application, you would use TradingSuite, which handles this.
    from project_x_py import create_realtime_client

    # 1. Initialization (handled by factory or TradingSuite)
    # realtime_client = await create_realtime_client(jwt, account_id)

    # 2. Connection (handled by TradingSuite.create() or client.connect())
    # if await realtime_client.connect():
    #     print("Successfully connected to both User and Market hubs.")

    #     # 3. Health Monitoring
    #     if realtime_client.is_connected():
    #         stats = realtime_client.get_stats()
    #         print(f"Events received so far: {stats['events_received']}")

    #     # 4. Token Refresh (if managing tokens manually)
    #     # new_token = await get_new_token()
    #     # await realtime_client.update_jwt_token(new_token)

    #     # 5. Disconnection (handled by TradingSuite context manager or client.disconnect())
    #     await realtime_client.disconnect()
    ```

        Connect to ProjectX Gateway SignalR hubs asynchronously.

        event streaming. Connections are made concurrently for efficiency.

        Returns:
            bool: True if both hubs connected successfully, False otherwise

        Connection Process:
            1. Sets up connections if not already done
            2. Stores event loop for cross-thread operations
            3. Starts user hub connection

            5. Waits for connection establishment
            6. Updates connection statistics
