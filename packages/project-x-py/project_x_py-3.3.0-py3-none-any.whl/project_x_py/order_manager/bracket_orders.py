Async bracket order strategies for ProjectX.

Author: @TexasCoding
Date: 2025-08-02

Overview:
    Provides mixin logic for placing and managing bracket ordersâ€”sophisticated, three-legged
    order strategies consisting of entry, stop loss, and take profit orders. Ensures risk
    controls are established atomically and linked to positions for robust trade automation.

Key Features:
    - Place async bracket orders (entry, stop, target) as a single operation
    - Price/side validation and position link management
    - Automatic risk management: stops and targets managed with entry
    - Integrates with core OrderManager and position tracking
    - Comprehensive error handling and validation
    - Real-time tracking of all bracket components

Bracket Order Components:
    - Entry Order: Primary order to establish position (limit or market)
    - Stop Loss Order: Risk management order triggered if price moves against position
    - Take Profit Order: Profit target order triggered if price moves favorably

The bracket order ensures that risk management is in place immediately when the entry
order fills, providing consistent trade management without manual intervention.

Example Usage:
    ```python
    # V3.1: Place bracket orders with TradingSuite
    import asyncio
    from project_x_py import TradingSuite


    async def main():
        # Initialize suite with integrated order manager
        suite = await TradingSuite.create("MNQ")

        # Get current market price for realistic order placement
        current_price = await suite.data.get_current_price()

        # V3.1: Place a bullish bracket order (buy with stop below, target above)
        bracket = await suite.orders.place_bracket_order(
            contract_id=suite.instrument_id,
            side=0,  # Buy
            size=1,
            entry_price=current_price - 10.0,  # Enter below market
            stop_loss_price=current_price - 30.0,  # Risk: $30 per contract
            take_profit_price=current_price + 20.0,  # Reward: $30 per contract
            entry_type="limit",  # Can also use "market"
        )

        print(f"Bracket order placed successfully:")
        print(f"  Entry Order ID: {bracket.entry_order_id}")
        print(f"  Stop Loss ID: {bracket.stop_order_id}")
        print(f"  Take Profit ID: {bracket.target_order_id}")

        # V3.1: Place a bearish bracket order (sell with stop above, target below)
        short_bracket = await suite.orders.place_bracket_order(
            contract_id=suite.instrument_id,
            side=1,  # Sell
            size=2,
            entry_price=current_price + 10.0,  # Enter above market for short
            stop_loss_price=current_price + 30.0,  # Stop above for short
            take_profit_price=current_price - 20.0,  # Target below for short
        )

        await suite.disconnect()


    asyncio.run(main())

        Place a bracket order with entry, stop loss, and take profit orders.

        A bracket order is a sophisticated order strategy that consists of three linked orders:
        1. Entry order (limit or market) - The primary order to establish a position
        2. Stop loss order - Risk management order that's triggered if price moves against position
        3. Take profit order - Profit target order that's triggered if price moves favorably

        The advantage of bracket orders is automatic risk management - the stop loss and
        take profit orders are placed immediately when the entry fills, ensuring consistent
        trade management. Each order is tracked and associated with the position.

        This method performs comprehensive validation to ensure:
        - Stop loss is properly positioned relative to entry price
        - Take profit is properly positioned relative to entry price
        - All prices are aligned to instrument tick sizes
        - Order sizes are valid and positive

        Args:
            contract_id: The contract ID to trade (e.g., "MGC", "MES", "F.US.EP")
            side: Order side: 0=Buy, 1=Sell
            size: Number of contracts to trade (positive integer)
            entry_price: Entry price for the position (ignored for market entries)
            stop_loss_price: Stop loss price for risk management
                For buy orders: must be below entry price
                For sell orders: must be above entry price
            take_profit_price: Take profit price (profit target)
                For buy orders: must be above entry price
                For sell orders: must be below entry price
            entry_type: Entry order type: "limit" (default) or "market"
            account_id: Account ID. Uses default account if None.
            custom_tag: Custom identifier for the bracket orders (not used in current implementation)

        Returns:
            BracketOrderResponse with comprehensive information including:
                - success: Whether the bracket order was placed successfully
                - entry_order_id: ID of the entry order
                - stop_order_id: ID of the stop loss order
