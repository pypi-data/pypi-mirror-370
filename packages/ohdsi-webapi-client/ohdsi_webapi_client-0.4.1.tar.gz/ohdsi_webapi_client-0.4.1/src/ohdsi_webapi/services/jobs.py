        Parameters
        ----------
        execution_id : int
            The execution ID returned when starting a background job
            (e.g., from cohort generation).

        Returns
        -------
        JobStatus
            Current job status with status string and execution ID.

        Examples

        >>> # Start a cohort generation
        >>> job = client.cohorts.generate(cohort_id=123, source_key="SYNPUF1K")
        >>>
