# Xenoverse: Toward Training General-Purpose Learning Agents (GLA) with Randomized Worlds

## xenoverse instead of a single universe

The recent research indicates that the generalization ability of learning agents is primarily dependent on the diversity of training environments. However, the real-world poses a significant limitation on the diversity itself, e.g., physical laws, the gravitational constant is almost constant. We believe this limitation is serious bottleneck to incentivize artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Xenoverse is a collection of extremely diverse worlds by procedural generation based on completely random parameters. We propose that AGI should not be trained and adapted in a single universe, but in xenoverse.

## collection of xenoverse environments

- [AnyMDP](xenoverse/anymdp): Procedurally generated unlimited general-purpose Markov Decision Processes (MDP) in discrete spaces.

- [AnyHVAC](xenoverse/anyhvac): Procedurally generated random room and equipments for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control

- [MetaLanguage](xenoverse/metalang): Pseudo-language generated from randomized neural networks, benchmarking in-context language learning (ICLL).

- [MazeWorld](xenoverse/mazeworld): Procedurally generated immersed 3D mazes with diverse maze structures.

- [MazeControl](xenoverse/metcontrol): Randomized environments for classic control and locomotions.
