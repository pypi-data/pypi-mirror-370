    Load Parquet files with enterprise-grade performance optimization and cluster
    validation.

    Provides high-performance Parquet data ingestion optimized for analytics workloads
    and data lake processing. This function leverages Spark's native columnar processing
    capabilities while adding intelligent column selection, comprehensive error handling
    , and cluster-wide validation essential for production data processing environments.

    The function is specifically designed for large-scale analytics scenarios where
    Parquet's columnar format provides significant performance advantages through
    predicate pushdown, compression efficiency, and schema evolution capabilities.

    Args:
        spark: Active SparkSession instance configured for distributed processing.
              Must have appropriate executor resources allocated for the expected
              data volume. Used for both DataFrame creation and cluster validation.
        file_path: Path to Parquet file or directory containing Parquet files.
                  Can be provided as string or Path object. Supports single files,
                  partitioned directories, and multi-file datasets. Compatible with
                  local storage, network mounts, HDFS, and cloud storage systems.
        columns: Optional list of specific column names to load for performance
                optimization. When specified, enables predicate pushdown to read only
                required columns, significantly improving performance and reducing
                memory usage for wide tables. Column names must exist in the Parquet
                schema or ValueError will be raised.
        shared_mount: Boolean indicating whether the file resides on shared storage
                     accessible by all cluster nodes. When True, triggers comprehensive
                     cluster validation to ensure all executors can access the data.
                     When False, uses local file URI scheme for single-node processing.
        **options: Additional Spark options for fine-tuning Parquet processing:
                  - 'mergeSchema': Boolean to merge schemas across multiple files
                  - 'pathGlobFilter': Glob pattern to filter files in directory
                  - 'recursiveFileLookup': Boolean to recursively scan subdirectories
                  - 'datetimeRebaseMode': Handling of legacy datetime formats
                  - 'int96RebaseMode': Handling of legacy timestamp formats

    Returns:
        Spark DataFrame containing the loaded Parquet data:
        - Schema automatically inferred from Parquet metadata
        - Data types preserved from original Parquet format
        - Partitioning information maintained for query optimization
        - Column order preserved from file schema
        - Null values properly handled according to Parquet specification

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the specified file or directory does not exist.
                          Error message includes full path for troubleshooting.
        ValueError: If requested columns are not found in the Parquet schema.
                   The error specifies which columns are missing for easy correction.
        RuntimeError: If Parquet loading fails due to format corruption, permission
                     issues, cluster validation failures, or resource constraints.
                     Includes detailed error context for troubleshooting and resolution.

    Performance Optimization Features:
        **Column Selection (Predicate Pushdown)**:
        - Only specified columns are read from storage
        - Significant I/O reduction for wide tables
        - Memory usage optimization for large datasets
        - Network transfer reduction in distributed environments

        **Distributed Processing**:
        - Automatic file splitting across cluster executors
        - Parallel processing of partitioned datasets
        - Optimal resource utilization for large files
        - Load balancing across available cluster nodes

    Examples:
        Load complete Parquet dataset for full analysis:

         df = load_parquet(spark, "sales_data.parquet")
         print(f"Loaded {df.count()} records with {len(df.columns)} columns")
         df.printSchema()

        Optimized loading with column selection for analytics:

         # Load only required columns for performance
         analytics_df = load_parquet(
        ...     spark,
        ...     "large_dataset.parquet",
        ...     columns=["customer_id", "purchase_amount", "transaction_date"]
        ... )
         # Significantly faster than loading all columns

        Load partitioned dataset from shared storage:

         partitioned_df = load_parquet(
        ...     spark,
        ...     "/data/warehouse/sales/",  # Partitioned directory
        ...     shared_mount=True,
        ...     recursiveFileLookup=True,  # Include subdirectories
        ...     pathGlobFilter="*.parquet"  # Filter specific files
        ... )

        Load with schema merging for evolving datasets:

         evolved_df = load_parquet(
        ...     spark,
        ...     "evolving_dataset/",
        ...     mergeSchema=True,  # Handle schema evolution
        ...     datetimeRebaseMode="CORRECTED"  # Handle date formats
        ... )

        Performance comparison - column selection vs full load:

         # Full dataset load (slower)
         full_df = load_parquet(spark, "wide_table.parquet")

         # Optimized column selection (faster)
         subset_df = load_parquet(
        ...     spark,
        ...     "wide_table.parquet",
        ...     columns=["id", "name", "value"]
        ... )
         # Can be 10x faster for wide tables
