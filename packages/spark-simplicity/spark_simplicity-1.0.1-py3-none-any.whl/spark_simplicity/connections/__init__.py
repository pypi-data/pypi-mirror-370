**Usage Patterns:**
    Standard connection establishment and usage:

     from spark_simplicity.connections import (
    ...     JdbcSqlServerConnection,
    ...     SftpConnection,
    ...     RestApiConnection,
    ...     EmailSender
    ... )

     # Database connectivity for data processing
     db_config = {
    ...     'host': 'sqlserver.company.com',
    ...     'database': 'datawarehouse',
    ...     'user': 'spark_user',
    ...     'password': 'secure_password'
    ... }
     db_conn = JdbcSqlServerConnection(spark, db_config, logger)
     data_df = db_conn.query("SELECT * FROM sales_data WHERE date >= '2024-01-01'")

    Multi-system integration workflow:

     # Combine multiple connection types for complete workflow

     # 1. Extract data from database
     sales_data = db_conn.query("SELECT * FROM daily_sales")

     # 2. Enrich with external API data
     api_conn = RestApiConnection(spark, api_config, logger)
     enrichment_data = api_conn.get('/customer-segments')

     # 3. Process and export results
     processed_data = sales_data.join(enrichment_data, 'customer_id')

     # 4. Transfer files via SFTP
     sftp_conn = SftpConnection(spark, sftp_config, logger)
     sftp_conn.put('processed_results.csv', '/remote/reports/')

     # 5. Send email notifications
     email_sender = EmailSender(**email_config)
     email_sender.send_simple_email(
    ...     'team@company.com',
    ...     'Data Processing Complete',
    ...     'Daily sales processing completed successfully.'
    ... )

    Enterprise production deployment:

     # Production-ready configuration with error handling
     try:
    ...     # Initialize connections with comprehensive configuration
    ...     db_conn = JdbcSqlServerConnection(spark, db_config, logger)
    ...
    ...     # Execute business logic with connection reuse
    ...     quarterly_results = db_conn.query(quarterly_query, partitioning_config)
    ...
    ...     # Process results and distribute via multiple channels
    ...     process_and_distribute(quarterly_results, sftp_conn, email_sender)
    ...
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     logger.error(f"Workflow execution failed: {e}")
    ...     email_sender.send_simple_email(
    ...         admin_email, 'ALERT: Processing Failed', str(e)
    ...     )
    ...     raise

**Performance Considerations:**
    **Connection Efficiency**: Singleton pattern minimizes connection overhead
    **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup prevents resource leaks
    **Network Optimization**: Intelligent retry and timeout strategies
    **Memory Usage**: Optimized for large-scale data processing workflows
    **Concurrent Access**: Thread-safe implementations for parallel processing

**Security Best Practices:**
    **Credential Management**: Never hard-code credentials; use secure configuration
    **Network Security**: Always use encrypted connections in production environments
    **Certificate Validation**: Enable certificate verification for production
    deployments
    **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization controls
    **Audit Logging**: Monitor all connection activities for security compliance

**Operational Monitoring:**
    All connection managers provide comprehensive logging for:
    - Connection establishment and lifecycle events
    - Performance metrics and resource utilization
    - Error conditions and retry attempts
    - Security events and authentication activities
    - Operational statistics for performance optimization

    This connections package provides the foundation for all external system integration
    in Spark Simplicity, with each connection manager optimized for its specific
    protocol
    while maintaining consistent interfaces and enterprise-grade reliability suitable
    for both development and production environments.
