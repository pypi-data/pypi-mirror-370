# Issue #193: Add unit tests for async operations and concurrency

## System Prompt

You are orchestrating comprehensive testing for async operations and concurrent
execution patterns to ensure reliable behavior under concurrent load.

## Description

Async operations and concurrent execution patterns need specialized testing to
validate thread safety, resource management, and proper error handling in
concurrent contexts.

## Planning Instructions

Plan async and concurrency testing strategy focusing on:

- Async session and flow management validation
- Concurrent agent execution without race conditions
- Thread safety verification for shared resources
- Timeout handling and proper cancellation behavior
- Resource cleanup and disposal in async contexts
- Error propagation and handling in concurrent scenarios
- Deadlock prevention and resource contention management

**Concurrency Scenarios:**

- Multiple agents executing simultaneously
- Shared resource access patterns
- Timeout and cancellation scenarios
- Error propagation in concurrent workflows
- Resource cleanup after failures

Target: Comprehensive async reliability with race condition and deadlock
prevention.

## Synthesis Instructions

Synthesize async and concurrency testing implementation:

1. Async method behavior validation tests
2. Concurrent execution scenario testing
3. Thread safety and race condition detection
4. Timeout and cancellation mechanism tests
5. Resource management and cleanup verification
6. Error handling in async contexts validation
7. Performance testing for concurrent operations

**Output Location:**

- Place tests in `tests/async/` directory
- Create `test_async_operations.py` for core async logic
- Create `test_concurrency_patterns.py` for concurrent scenarios
- Create `test_resource_management.py` for cleanup testing
- Place async test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/async/`

## Context

Async reliability and performance validation that ensures the system can handle
concurrent operations safely and efficiently without race conditions or resource
leaks.
