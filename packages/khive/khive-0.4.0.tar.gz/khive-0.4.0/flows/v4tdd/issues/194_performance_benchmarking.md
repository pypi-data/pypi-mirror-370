# Issue #194: Add performance tests and benchmarking suite

## System Prompt

You are orchestrating comprehensive performance testing and benchmarking to
ensure khive maintains acceptable response times and resource usage under
various load conditions.

## Description

Performance testing ensures khive maintains acceptable response times, memory
usage, and scalability characteristics across all operational scenarios and load
conditions.

## Planning Instructions

Plan performance testing and benchmarking strategy focusing on:

- Agent composition time and memory usage profiling
- Orchestration workflow execution speed measurement
- File I/O and YAML parsing performance optimization
- Concurrent agent execution scalability testing
- Memory usage patterns and leak detection
- Database operation performance benchmarking
- Baseline metrics establishment and regression detection

**Performance Areas:**

- Single agent vs multi-agent execution scaling
- File operation throughput and latency
- Memory consumption patterns over time
- CPU usage optimization opportunities
- I/O bottleneck identification and resolution

Target: Comprehensive performance baseline with automated regression detection.

## Synthesis Instructions

Synthesize performance testing implementation:

1. Performance benchmark suite for core operations
2. Memory profiling and leak detection tests
3. Scalability testing with varying agent counts
4. Regression detection and CI integration
5. Resource usage monitoring and optimization
6. Load testing scenarios and stress tests
7. Performance documentation and optimization guides

**Output Location:**

- Place tests in `tests/performance/` directory
- Create `test_benchmarks.py` for core benchmarks
- Create `test_memory_profiling.py` for memory tests
- Create `test_scalability.py` for load testing
- Place performance results in `tests/results/performance/`

## Context

System performance and scalability validation that ensures khive can handle
production workloads efficiently and maintains performance characteristics over
time.
