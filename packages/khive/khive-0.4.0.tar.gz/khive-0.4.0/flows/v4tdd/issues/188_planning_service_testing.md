# Issue #188: Add unit tests for planning service and orchestration evaluation

## System Prompt

You are orchestrating comprehensive testing for the planning service that
evaluates task complexity and generates orchestration strategies.

## Description

The planning service evaluates task complexity and generates orchestration
strategies, requiring thorough testing of decision-making algorithms and model
validation.

## Planning Instructions

Plan planning service testing strategy focusing on:

- Task complexity assessment algorithm validation
- Agent count and role priority calculation logic
- Domain matching and selection accuracy
- Workflow pattern determination consistency
- Decision matrix validation and scoring
- Confidence calculation reliability
- Edge case handling for unusual inputs

**Algorithm Testing:**

- Various input scenarios with known expected outputs
- Boundary conditions and edge cases
- Consistency across multiple evaluations
- Integration with external planning models

Target: >90% code coverage with comprehensive algorithm validation.

## Synthesis Instructions

Synthesize planning service testing implementation:

1. Complexity assessment algorithm unit tests
2. Orchestration evaluation model validation tests
3. Decision matrix and scoring logic verification
4. Edge case and boundary condition testing
5. Pydantic model constraint validation
6. Integration tests with actual planning scenarios
7. Performance testing for planning operations

**Output Location:**

- Place tests in `tests/services/plan/` directory
- Create `test_planner_service.py` for core logic
- Create `test_evaluation_models.py` for model validation
- Create `test_complexity_assessment.py` for algorithms
- Place planning scenario fixtures in `tests/fixtures/planning/`

## Context

Essential service for intelligent task orchestration that makes critical
decisions about agent deployment and workflow patterns.
