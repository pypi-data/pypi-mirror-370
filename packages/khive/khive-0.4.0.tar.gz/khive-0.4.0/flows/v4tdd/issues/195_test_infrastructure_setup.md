# Issue #195: Set up test infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline

## System Prompt

You are orchestrating the setup of comprehensive testing infrastructure for the
khive project to enable reliable development workflows.

## Description

Establish comprehensive testing infrastructure with automated execution,
coverage reporting, and CI/CD integration.

## Planning Instructions

Plan test infrastructure setup focusing on:

- Test directory structure and organization
- Pytest configuration with appropriate plugins
- Coverage reporting and threshold enforcement
- Mock and fixture management systems
- CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing
- Performance testing setup and benchmarking
- Security test automation capabilities

Target: Complete testing foundation that supports all development workflows.

**Notes:**

- This is FOUNDATION work - sets up infrastructure for all other testing efforts
- Must integrate with existing GitHub Actions workflow
- Focus on comprehensive coverage reporting and automated execution
- Ensure scalability for future test additions

## Synthesis Instructions

Synthesize test infrastructure setup:

1. Complete pytest configuration with plugins and coverage settings
2. Test directory structure with proper organization
3. GitHub Actions workflow updates for automated testing
4. Mock and fixture framework setup
5. Performance testing infrastructure
6. Security testing integration
7. Documentation for test development and execution

**Output Location:**

- Place test configuration in project root (pytest.ini, pyproject.toml updates)
- Create `tests/` directory with proper structure
- Update `.github/workflows/` for CI integration
- Document testing guidelines in `tests/README.md`

## Context

Foundation for comprehensive testing strategy across the khive project, enabling
reliable development and quality assurance.
