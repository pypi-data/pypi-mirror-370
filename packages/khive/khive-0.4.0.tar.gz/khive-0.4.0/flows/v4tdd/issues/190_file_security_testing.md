# Issue #190: Add unit tests for file operations and security validation

## System Prompt

You are orchestrating comprehensive security testing for file operations
throughout khive to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure safe handling of user
input.

## Description

File operations throughout khive need comprehensive security testing to prevent
directory traversal, injection attacks, and other file-based vulnerabilities.

## Planning Instructions

Plan file security testing strategy focusing on:

- YAML file loading with malicious content and size limit testing
- Path sanitization effectiveness against directory traversal attacks
- Input validation for all user-provided file paths and content
- File existence and permission checking security
- Error handling for malformed and malicious file content
- Thread-safe file operations under concurrent access
- Prompt injection prevention in file-based content

**Security Attack Vectors:**

- Directory traversal attempts (../../../etc/passwd)
- File size limit bypass attempts
- Malicious YAML content and parsing bombs
- Prompt injection through file content
- Race conditions in file operations

Target: >95% security coverage with comprehensive attack vector validation.

## Synthesis Instructions

Synthesize file security testing implementation:

1. Directory traversal attack prevention validation tests
2. File size limit enforcement and bypass testing
3. Malicious content parsing and handling tests
4. Input sanitization effectiveness verification
5. Thread safety and concurrency security tests
6. Error handling security validation
7. Integration tests with actual attack scenarios

**Output Location:**

- Place tests in `tests/security/` directory
- Create `test_file_security.py` for core security tests
- Create `test_path_validation.py` for path security
- Create `test_input_sanitization.py` for input validation
- Place malicious test files in `tests/fixtures/security/`

## Context

Security-critical functionality that handles user input and file system
operations, requiring comprehensive protection against all known attack vectors.
