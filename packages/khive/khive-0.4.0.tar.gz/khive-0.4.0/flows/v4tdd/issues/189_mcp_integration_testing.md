# Issue #189: Add integration tests for MCP server configurations and toolkits

## System Prompt

You are orchestrating comprehensive integration testing for MCP server
functionality that enables Claude Code interactions within khive.

## Description

MCP integrations are critical for Claude Code functionality and need thorough
integration testing to ensure reliable operation and proper configuration
management.

## Planning Instructions

Plan MCP integration testing strategy focusing on:

- CC toolkit creation with various configuration options
- Permission mode handling and security validation
- MCP server lifecycle management and connection testing
- Configuration file copying and validation processes
- Workspace isolation and proper cleanup procedures
- Error handling for configuration and connection issues
- Integration with actual MCP protocol implementations

**Integration Scenarios:**

- Various permission modes and security contexts
- Configuration copying and workspace setup
- Server startup, connection, and shutdown cycles
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms

Target: Comprehensive integration testing covering all MCP interaction patterns.

## Synthesis Instructions

Synthesize MCP integration testing implementation:

1. CC toolkit creation and configuration tests
2. Permission mode and security validation tests
3. MCP server lifecycle integration tests
4. Configuration management and copying tests
5. Workspace isolation and cleanup verification
6. Error handling and recovery scenario tests
7. Performance tests for MCP operations

**Output Location:**

- Place tests in `tests/toolkits/cc/` directory
- Create `test_cc_creation.py` for toolkit tests
- Create `test_mcp_integration.py` for protocol tests
- Create `test_configuration.py` for config management
- Place MCP test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/mcp/`

## Context

Critical integration layer that enables Claude Code functionality, requiring
thorough testing of all configuration and communication scenarios.
