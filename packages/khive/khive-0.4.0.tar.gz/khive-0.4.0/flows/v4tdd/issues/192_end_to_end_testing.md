# Issue #192: Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows

## System Prompt

You are orchestrating comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure the complete
khive system works together properly across all user workflows.

## Description

End-to-end testing ensures the complete khive system integration works properly
from CLI input through orchestration execution to final deliverable generation.

## Planning Instructions

Plan end-to-end testing strategy focusing on:

- Complete user workflows from CLI to execution completion
- Multi-agent coordination and handoff scenarios
- Quality gate evaluation and refinement cycles
- Session persistence and recovery mechanisms
- Error propagation and system-wide recovery
- Performance validation under realistic load conditions
- Integration with external dependencies and services

**Workflow Scenarios:**

- Simple single-agent task execution
- Complex multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Quality gate failures and refinement cycles
- System recovery from various failure modes
- Large-scale workflow execution patterns

Target: Comprehensive system integration validation with realistic user
scenarios.

## Synthesis Instructions

Synthesize end-to-end testing implementation:

1. Complete user workflow integration tests
2. Multi-agent coordination scenario testing
3. Quality gate and refinement cycle validation
4. Error recovery and system resilience tests
5. Performance testing under load conditions
6. External dependency integration validation
7. User experience and workflow continuity tests

**Output Location:**

- Place tests in `tests/integration/` directory
- Create `test_complete_workflows.py` for full scenarios
- Create `test_multi_agent_coordination.py` for orchestration
- Create `test_system_recovery.py` for resilience testing
- Place workflow test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/workflows/`

## Context

System-wide integration validation that ensures all components work together to
deliver reliable user experiences across complete workflows.
