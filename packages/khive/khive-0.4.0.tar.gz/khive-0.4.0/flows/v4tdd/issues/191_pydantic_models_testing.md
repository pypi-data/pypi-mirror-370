# Issue #191: Add unit tests for Pydantic models and data validation

## System Prompt

You are orchestrating comprehensive testing for all Pydantic models to ensure
data integrity, validation accuracy, and API reliability.

## Description

All Pydantic models need thorough validation testing to ensure data integrity,
proper constraint enforcement, and reliable serialization across the khive
system.

## Planning Instructions

Plan Pydantic model testing strategy focusing on:

- Model validation with valid and invalid data scenarios
- Field constraint enforcement (ranges, lengths, patterns)
- Enum value validation and error handling
- Nested model validation and complex compositions
- Serialization and deserialization consistency
- Error message clarity and actionability
- Custom validator behavior and edge cases

**Validation Scenarios:**

- Boundary value testing for numeric fields
- String length and pattern validation
- Required vs optional field handling
- Type coercion and validation
- Complex nested model scenarios

Target: Comprehensive validation coverage for all models with clear error
handling.

## Synthesis Instructions

Synthesize Pydantic model testing implementation:

1. Individual model validation test suites
2. Field constraint and boundary testing
3. Serialization/deserialization consistency tests
4. Error message validation and clarity tests
5. Custom validator behavior verification
6. Nested model and composition testing
7. Performance testing for large model operations

**Output Location:**

- Place tests in `tests/models/` directory organized by service
- Create `test_orchestration_models.py` for orchestration types
- Create `test_composition_models.py` for composition types
- Create `test_base_models.py` for shared base types
- Place model test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/models/`

## Context

Data integrity foundation that ensures reliable API behavior and prevents
invalid data from propagating through the system.
