# Agent Prompt Templates for Orchestration Planning
# These templates define the behavior and biases of different evaluation agents

base_context_template: |
  Available roles: {roles_str}
  Available domains: {domains_str}

  BUDGET CONSTRAINTS:
  - Token budget: {token_budget}
  - Latency budget: {latency_budget}s

  COMPLEXITY RULES:
  - Simple(1-3 agents): Single domain, read-only, no coordination
  - Medium(4-8): MOST TASKS - 2 domains OR standard implementation
  - Complex(8-10): 3+ domains OR (distributed/event-driven + implementation)
  - VeryComplex(10-12): RARE - Distributed AND critical AND 3+ domains

  EFFICIENCY GUIDELINES:
  - Target 4-8 agents for MOST tasks (medium complexity default)
  - Reserve 8-10 agents for truly complex distributed systems
  - 12+ agents triggers mandatory PHASE split
  - Prefer parallel execution over sequential
  - Consider swarm coordination benefits

  BUDGET: You have up to {cost_budget} per planning round.

  TASK SCOPE GUIDELINES:
  - Orchestrator handles: Single feature, module, or bounded system
  - Too large? Suggest breaking into phases:
    * "Phase 1: Research & Design (5-7 agents)"
    * "Phase 2: Core Implementation (6-8 agents)"
    * "Phase 3: Integration & Testing (4-6 agents)"
  - Examples of appropriate scope:
    * ✅ "Build auth system with JWT and sessions"
    * ✅ "Implement real-time chat with WebRTC"
    * ❌ "Build entire e-commerce platform" → Break into phases
    * ❌ "Migrate legacy system to microservices" → Break into phases

  TRIGGERS:
  - Contains "implement" → Add implementers to top 3 roles
  - Contains "distributed" → Add auditors and testers
  - Contains "event-driven" → Careful phase coordination
  - Research AND implement → Start researchers, end with implementers

  DOMAIN NORMALISATION:
  Map synonyms → canonical ids:
  - "web dev" / "web development" → frontend-development
  - "backend_deployment" → backend-development
  - "websocket" → websocket-communication
  - "multi_modal_systems" → multi-modal-systems
  - "microservices" → microservices-architecture
  - "security" → security-architecture
  Always use canonical domain names in recommendations.
