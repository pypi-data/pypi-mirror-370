- [ ] Clear error messages for missing dependencies or permissions

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Hook Integration
- [ ] Hook correctly intercepts Claude Code tool calls
- [ ] Permission decisions work as expected (allow/deny/ask)
- [ ] Error conditions fail safely to "ask"
- [ ] Debug output shows rule matching correctly
- [ ] No sensitive information leaked in debug output

### Pattern Matching
- [ ] Glob patterns work correctly (`Edit(*.md)`, `Read(**)`)
- [ ] Regex patterns work correctly (`Bash(/git (status|diff)/)`)
- [ ] MCP-specific patterns work for tool calls
- [ ] DoS protection prevents regex backtracking attacks
- [ ] Path traversal attacks are prevented

### Profile System
- [ ] Default profiles load correctly
- [ ] Custom profiles override defaults appropriately
- [ ] Profile hierarchy works (project > home > builtin)
- [ ] Invalid profiles are rejected with clear errors
- [ ] Profile switching maintains security

## üìù Documentation

### README
- [ ] Installation instructions are accurate and complete
- [ ] Quick start guide works for new users
- [ ] All examples in README are tested and functional
- [ ] Feature descriptions match actual functionality
- [ ] Links to repository/issues are correct

### Technical Documentation
- [ ] CLAUDE.md reflects current development setup
- [ ] Architecture documentation matches implementation
- [ ] Pattern examples are comprehensive and correct
- [ ] API documentation is up-to-date (if applicable)

### User-Facing Documentation
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable
- [ ] CLI help text is complete and accurate
- [ ] Configuration examples are valid YAML
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide covers common issues

## üîÑ Integration Testing

### Claude Code Integration
- [ ] Works with latest Claude Code version
- [ ] Hook registration persists after restart
- [ ] Permission decisions integrate seamlessly
- [ ] No conflicts with existing Claude Code features
- [ ] Works in both interactive and batch modes

### Environment Testing
- [ ] Works on macOS (primary development platform)
- [ ] Works on Linux (test in container if possible)
- [ ] Works on Windows (test if possible)
- [ ] Works with different Python versions (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- [ ] Works with different project structures

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Handles missing .claudeguard directory gracefully
- [ ] Handles corrupted profile files safely
- [ ] Handles permission denied errors appropriately
- [ ] Handles network issues during installation
- [ ] Handles concurrent access to profiles

## üöÄ Distribution

### Package Publishing
- [ ] Test installation from built package: `uv tool install dist/claudeguard-*.whl`
- [ ] Test installation from PyPI test server (if using)
- [ ] Verify package contents with `tar -tzf dist/claudeguard-*.tar.gz`
- [ ] Check package size is reasonable
- [ ] Verify no unnecessary files included in distribution

### Repository State
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] No uncommitted changes: `git status`
- [ ] Version tag created: `git tag v0.1.0`
- [ ] Repository is public and accessible
- [ ] Issues template exists (if desired)
- [ ] Contributing guidelines are clear

## ‚úÖ Final Validation

### End-to-End Test
- [ ] Fresh clone of repository
- [ ] Install in clean environment: `uv tool install claudeguard`
- [ ] Run through complete workflow:
  - [ ] `claudeguard install` in test project
  - [ ] Create and switch between profiles
  - [ ] Test actual Claude Code integration
  - [ ] Verify permission decisions work correctly
- [ ] Uninstall cleanly: `claudeguard uninstall`

### Release Readiness

- [ ] Release notes prepared (if applicable)
- [ ] Backup of current state created
- [ ] Team notified of pending release (if applicable)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Checks

Before publishing, manually verify these security-critical aspects:

1. **No credentials in code**: Search entire codebase for API keys, passwords, tokens
2. **Safe defaults**: Confirm fail-safe behavior defaults to "ask", never "allow"
3. **Input validation**: All user inputs properly validated and sanitized
4. **DoS protection**: Regex patterns have timeouts and complexity limits
5. **Path traversal**: File operations cannot escape intended directories
6. **Privilege escalation**: No operations run with elevated privileges unexpectedly
