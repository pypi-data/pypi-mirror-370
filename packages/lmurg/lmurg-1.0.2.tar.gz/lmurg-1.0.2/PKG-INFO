<h3>Overview ðŸ“–</h3>

This Python-based <a href='https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-gpt'>NNGPT</a> project leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the creation of neural network architectures, streamlining the design process for machine learning practitioners. It leverages various neural networks from the <a href="https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-dataset">LEMUR Dataset</a> to fine-tune LLMs and provide insights into potential architectures during the creation of new neural network models.

## Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (recommended)
For Linux/Mac:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
For Windows:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

It is also assumed that CUDA 12.6 is installed. If you have a different version, please replace 'cu126' with the appropriate version number.

## Environment for NNGPT Developers
### Pip package manager

#### Prerequisites for mpi4py package:
* On Debian/Ubuntu systems, run:
  
         sudo apt install libmpich-dev    # for MPICH
  
         sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev  # for Open MPI

* On Fedora/RHEL systems, run:
  
         sudo dnf install mpich-devel     # for MPICH
  
         sudo dnf install openmpi-devel   # for Open MPI
  
Create a virtual environment, activate it, and run the following command to install all the project dependencies:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
pip install -r req-no-isolation.txt --no-build-isolation --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

If there are installation problems, install the dependencies from the 'requirements.txt' file one by one.

## Update of NN Dataset
Remove an old version and install LEMUR Dataset from GitHub to get the most recent code and statistics updates:
```bash
rm -rf db
pip uninstall nn-dataset -y
pip install git+https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-dataset --upgrade --force --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```
Installing the stable version:
```bash
pip install nn-dataset --upgrade --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```
Adding functionality to export data to Excel files and generate plots for <a href='https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-stat'>analyzing neural network performance</a>:
```bash
pip install nn-stat --upgrade --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```
and export/generate:
```bash
python -m ab.stat.export
```

### Docker
All versions of this project are compatible with <a href='https://hub.docker.com/r/abrainone/ai-linux' target='_blank'>AI Linux</a> and can be seamlessly executed within the AI Linux Docker container.

Installing the latest version of the project from GitHub
```bash
docker run --rm -u $(id -u):ab -v $(pwd):/a/mm abrainone/ai-linux bash -c "[ -d nn-gpt ] && git -C nn-gpt pull || git -c advice.detachedHead=false clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-gpt"
```

Running script
```bash
docker run --rm -u $(id -u):ab --shm-size=16G -v $(pwd)/nn-gpt:/a/mm abrainone/ai-linux bash -c "python -m ab.gpt.TuneNNGen_8B"
```

The recently added dependencies might be missing in the <a href='https://hub.docker.com/r/abrainone/ai-linux' target='_blank'>AI Linux</a>. In this case, you can create a container from the Docker image ```abrainone/ai-linux```, install the missing packages (preferably using ```pip install <package name>```), and then create a new image from the container using ```docker commit <container name> <new image name>```. You can use this new image locally or push it to the registry for deployment on the computer cluster.

## Use

- **`ab.gpt.NNAlter*.py`** â€“ Generates modified neural network models.  
  Use the `-e` argument to set the number of epochs for the initial CV model generation.

- **`ab.gpt.NNEval.py`** â€“ Evaluates the models generated in the previous step.

- **`ab.gpt.TuneNNGen*.py`** â€“ Performs fine-tuning and evaluation of an LLM. For evaluation purposes, the LLM generates neural network models, which are then trained to assess improvements in the LLMâ€™s performance on this task. The -s flag allows skipping model generation for the specified number of epochs.
