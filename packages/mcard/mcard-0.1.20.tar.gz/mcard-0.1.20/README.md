MCard is a powerful Python library implementing an algebraically closed data structure for content-addressable storage. It provides a robust system where every piece of content is uniquely identified by its cryptographic hash and temporally ordered, enabling content verification, deduplication, and versioning.

The system features a modular architecture with support for multiple content types and a flexible database backend (SQLite).

## 📦 Data Model

MCard is built around a simple but powerful data model:

- **Card**: The fundamental unit of content with a unique hash
- **Hash**: Cryptographic identifier for content (SHA-256 by default)
- **Content**: Optimized BLOB storage
  - Binary format ensures maximum performance and exact content preservation
  - Efficient storage for both text and binary data
  - MCard's browsing interface provides human-readable views when needed
- **G-Time**: Global time value for temporal ordering of content claims
- **Temporal Ordering**: Built-in support for temporal ordering of content claims
- **Modular Architecture**: Extensible design with pluggable components
- **Type Safety**: Built with Python type hints and Pydantic models
- **Async Support**: Asynchronous API for improved performance

## ✨ Features

- **Content-Addressable Storage**: Store and retrieve content using cryptographic hashes (SHA-256 by default)
- **Optimized Storage**: BLOB format ensures maximum performance while MCard handles all text conversions
- **Content Type Detection**: Automatic detection of various file formats (JSON, XML, CSV, Markdown, Python, etc.)
- **Temporal Ordering**: Built-in support for temporal ordering of content claims
- **Modular Architecture**: Extensible design with pluggable components
- **Type Safety**: Built with Python type hints and Pydantic models
- **Async Support**: Asynchronous API for improved performance

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Database Inspection

MCard uses BLOB storage for optimal performance and data integrity. The binary format allows for efficient storage and retrieval while MCard handles all necessary text conversions. To inspect the database:

```bash
# Open the database in SQLite CLI
sqlite3 mcard.db

# View the schema
.schema

# View binary content (first 20 bytes as hex)
SELECT hash, hex(substr(content, 1, 20)) as preview, g_time FROM card LIMIT 5;

# MCard's API provides easy access to content in various formats:
# - get_content() - Returns raw bytes for maximum performance
# - get_content(as_text=True) - Returns decoded text when needed
# - to_dict() - Automatically converts content to appropriate formats
```

### Version 0.1.20 (2025-08-18)

#### Feature: Safe Fallback for Problematic Files
- Added opt-in fallback to safely load problematic files (e.g., extremely large single-line text or unstructured binaries).
- When enabled, files are read as capped binary BLOBs without decoding to avoid hangs/crashes.
- Default remains unchanged: problematic files are skipped unless explicitly included.

#### API Updates
- `mcard.file_utility.load_file_to_collection(path, collection, recursive=False, include_problematic=False, max_bytes_on_problem=2*1024*1024)`
  - `include_problematic=True` to include files detected as problematic.
  - `max_bytes_on_problem` caps bytes read during fallback (default 2MB).

#### Bug Fixes
- Restored `@classmethod` on `FileUtility._process_file(...)` to fix invocation errors introduced by an incorrect `@staticmethod` change.
- All tests pass.

---

- Switched to `uv` as the package manager for faster and more reliable dependency resolution
- Updated installation instructions to use `uv`
- Simplified dependency management with `pyproject.toml`

### Bug Fixes

#### Critical: Database Initialization (2024-06-10)

Fixed a critical issue in the SQLite database initialization that was causing data loss. Previously, the database would be recreated and all data would be lost every time the application started. The fix ensures that:

- Existing databases are preserved between application restarts
- The database schema is only created if it doesn't already exist
- All existing data remains intact during application updates

This change is particularly important for production deployments where data persistence is crucial. The fix was implemented in the `SQLiteConnection.setup_database()` method, which now properly checks for existing tables before attempting to create them.

### Database Schema Cleanup (2024-06-10)

Removed the unused `file_type` field from the database schema to improve efficiency and maintainability. The change includes:

- Removed `file_type` column from the `card` table schema
- Verified that no existing code was using this field
- All tests continue to pass with the simplified schema

This change makes the database more efficient by removing unused storage and simplifying the schema. The schema now only contains the essential fields: `hash`, `content`, and `g_time`.

## Core Concepts

MCard implements an algebraically closed system where:
1. Every MCard is uniquely identified by its content hash (consistently using SHA-256 by default, with other algorithms configurable).
2. Every MCard has an associated claim time (timezone-aware timestamp with microsecond precision).
3. The database maintains these invariants automatically.
4. Content integrity is guaranteed through immutable hashes.
5. Temporal ordering is preserved at microsecond precision.

This design provides several key guarantees:
- **Content Integrity**: The content hash serves as both identifier and verification mechanism.
- **Temporal Signature**: All cards are associated with a timestamp: `g_time`.
- **Precedence Verification**: The claim time enables determination of content presentation order.
- **Algebraic Closure**: Any operation on MCards produces results that maintain these properties.
- **Type Safety**: Built on Pydantic with strict validation and type checking.

### Required Attributes for Each MCard

Each MCard **must** have the following three required attributes:

#### 1. **`content`**: The actual data being stored (string or bytes).
#### 2. **`hash`**: A cryptographic hash of the content, using SHA-256 by default (configurable to other algorithms).
#### 3. **`g_time`**: A timezone-aware timestamp with microsecond precision, representing the global time when the card was claimed.

## Database Technologies

We will be using embedded database technologies, such as SQLite, DuckDB, and LanceDB initially, to provide efficient and reliable data storage solutions for MCard. These technologies are well-suited for handling the requirements of content-addressable storage and will allow for easy integration and management of data within the application.

## Examples

### Default MCard API Example: `examples/MCard_Demo.py`

This script demonstrates the simplest way to use the MCard API through the `default_utility` interface. It covers:

- Adding new cards (with plain text or dictionaries, which are auto-converted to JSON)
- Retrieving cards by hash
- Searching for cards by content
- Counting the total number of cards in the collection

#### How to Run the Demo

```bash
python examples/MCard_Demo.py
```

#### Key Features
- **Minimal Setup**: Uses `from mcard import default_utility` for immediate access to core functionality.
- **Add and Retrieve**: Shows how to add cards and retrieve them by hash.
- **Search**: Demonstrates searching for cards containing a specific substring.
- **Summary Output**: Prints the total number of cards and search results.

---

### Modular Content Loader Example: `examples/Content_Loader.py`

This script demonstrates how to use the MCard system's content detection and storage features in a modular, easy-to-understand way. It:

- Loads files from `data/test_content/` (supports both text and binary types)
- Uses the `ContentTypeInterpreter` to detect file types and validate content
- Creates MCards for each file, handling text and binary content appropriately
- Saves processed files to `data/loaded_content/` with unique, type-appropriate filenames
- Prints summaries of processed files and cleans up temporary files

#### How to Run the Example

```bash
python examples/Content_Loader.py
```

#### Key Features of the Example
- **Modular Functions**: The script is organized into clear, single-purpose functions (e.g., `load_test_files`, `create_mcard_for_file`, `save_card_to_file`, etc.) for maintainability and extensibility.
- **Automatic Content Type Detection**: Uses file signatures and content validation to determine file type and extension.
- **Binary and Text Handling**: Handles binary files (e.g., images) and text files differently, ensuring correct storage and retrieval.
- **Output Directory**: All processed content is saved to `data/loaded_content/` (which is now gitignored).
- **Temporary File Cleanup**: Removes temporary binary files after processing.

See the script and its docstrings for further details and customization options.

### Handling Problematic Files (very large/single-line)

Some files can be pathological (e.g., extremely large single-line text or unstructured binaries) and may hang or fail if decoded as text. The loader can now safely fall back to binary BLOB reads with a configurable byte cap.

- Defaults remain safe: problematic files are skipped.
- Opt-in loading reads capped bytes as binary and stores them as `application/octet-stream`.

Example using `load_file_to_collection()` from `mcard.file_utility`:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from mcard.model.card_collection import CardCollection
from mcard.file_utility import load_file_to_collection

collection = CardCollection()

# Load a single file with fallback enabled (reads up to 2MB as binary if problematic)
results = load_file_to_collection(
    Path("tests/test_data/OneMoreLongStringFile.js"),
    collection,
    include_problematic=True,            # opt-in to include problematic files
    max_bytes_on_problem=2 * 1024 * 1024 # cap bytes when falling back
)

# Or load a directory recursively with the same options
results = load_file_to_collection(
    Path("tests/test_data"),
    collection,
    recursive=True,
    include_problematic=True,
    max_bytes_on_problem=2 * 1024 * 1024
)
```

Notes:

- The content is stored as bytes in the `MCard`. Text decoding is only applied when the detected MIME is textual.
- When falling back, MIME type is set to `application/octet-stream`.
- Default behavior (when `include_problematic=False`) is unchanged and will skip problematic files.


## .gitignore Notes

- The `data/loaded_content/` directory is now included in `.gitignore` and will not be tracked by git. This ensures that output/generated files do not pollute the repository.

## PyTest Configuration

- The project uses [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing.
- Tests are located in the `tests` directory.
- The configuration file `pytest.ini` specifies test paths and naming conventions.

## Logging Configuration

-- The project uses Python's built-in `logging` with a centralized configuration in `mcard/config/logging_config.py`.
-- Logs are written to `logs/mcard.log` using a rotating file handler (max 10MB, 5 backups).
-- The logging format includes timestamp, logger name, level, and message.
-- Logging is not configured on import. Entry points (your scripts, CLIs, apps, tests) should explicitly call `setup_logging()` once at startup.
-- Log levels are environment-driven via `MCARD_SERVICE_LOG_LEVEL` (default `DEBUG`). The package logger `mcard` defaults to `INFO`, the root logger defaults to `WARNING`.

### Usage

```python
from mcard.config.logging_config import setup_logging
import logging

def main():
    setup_logging()  # configure console + rotating file handlers
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.info("MCard app started")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Environment variables

- `MCARD_SERVICE_LOG_LEVEL` (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`) controls handler levels.
- Logs directory: `logs/` at the project root. The file name is `mcard.log`.

Notes:
- `run_mcard.py` demonstrates calling `setup_logging()` explicitly.
- For library modules, use `logging.getLogger(__name__)` and avoid configuring logging in module scope.

## Running Tests

To run tests:
```bash
pytest
```

To run tests with coverage:
```bash
pytest --cov=mcard
```

## Hegel's Dialectic in Testing and CI/CD

Hegel's dialectic is a philosophical framework that describes the process of development and change through a triadic structure: thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Here's how it relates to software testing and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

1. **Thesis (Initial Code)**: Represents the initial code or feature implementation, the starting point where a developer writes code to fulfill a specific requirement or feature.

2. **Antithesis (Testing and Bugs)**: Arises during the testing phase, where tests are executed. If tests fail or bugs are discovered, they represent a challenge to the initial implementation, highlighting discrepancies between intended functionality and actual behavior.

3. **Synthesis (Refinement and Improvement)**: Occurs when developers address the issues identified during testing, leading to a refined version of the code that resolves conflicts between the initial implementation and testing outcomes.

### CI/CD Integration
In a CI/CD pipeline, this dialectical process is continuous:

- **Continuous Integration**: Developers frequently integrate code changes into a shared repository. Each integration triggers automated tests, allowing for rapid identification of issues against the current codebase.

- **Continuous Deployment**: Once the code passes testing, it can be automatically deployed, representing the synthesis where refined code is made available to users.

This iterative process fosters continuous improvement, where each round of testing and deployment leads to better software quality and functionality. By applying Hegel's dialectic, teams can embrace the idea that conflict (in the form of bugs and failures) is a natural and necessary part of the development process, ultimately leading to a more robust and effective product.

## Handling Duplicate Events

When a duplicate card is detected, the `duplicate_event_card` is assigned a new timestamp value. This ensures that even though the content is identical to the original card, the hash value will be unique due to the different timestamp. This mechanism allows for robust handling of duplicate content while maintaining the integrity of the system.

## MD5 Collision Testing

The test suite includes verification of MD5 collision detection using known collision pairs from the FastColl attack. These pairs produce identical MD5 hashes despite having different content:

### MD5 Collision Pair
```
Input 1:
4dc968ff0ee35c209572d4777b721587d36fa7b21bdc56b74a3dc0783e7b9518afbfa200a8284bf36e8e4b55b35f427593d849676da0d1555d8360fb5f07fea2
                                                                     ^^^                                    ^^^

Input 2:
4dc968ff0ee35c209572d4777b721587d36fa7b21bdc56b74a3dc0783e7b9518afbfa202a8284bf36e8e4b55b35f427593d849676da0d1d55d8360fb5f07fea2
                                                                     ^^^                                    ^^^
```

Key differences:
1. `200` vs `202`
2. `d15` vs `d1d`

Both inputs produce the same MD5 hash value, demonstrating MD5's vulnerability to collision attacks. This is why MCard defaults to using more secure hash functions like SHA-256.

## Testing Behavior

The current tests, particularly `@test_sqlite_persistence.py`, will always clear the database after one of the test functions is run. This means that `test_mcard.db` will only contain the data from the last test executed. If the `clear()` function in the fixture is uncommented, it will remove the content of the last test as well.

## Core Dependencies

- `SQLAlchemy==1.4.47`: SQL toolkit and ORM
- `aiosqlite==0.17.0`: Async SQLite database driver
- `python-dateutil==2.8.2`: Date/time utilities

source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies with uv
uv pip sync pyproject.toml
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use MCard in your Python code:

```python
from mcard.model.card import MCard
from mcard.model.card_collection import CardCollection

# Create a new card
card = MCard(content="Hello, MCard!")

# Create a card collection
collection = CardCollection()

# Add the card to the collection
collection.add(card)

# Retrieve the card by its hash
retrieved_card = collection.get_by_hash(card.hash)
print(retrieved_card.content)  # Outputs: Hello, MCard!
```


# Or use the installed command-line entry point
mcard
```

## Recent Changes

### Directory Structure Updates
- The `hash_algorithms` directory has been renamed to `algorithms` for simplicity and clarity.
- The `hash_validator.py` file has been renamed to `validator.py` to simplify the naming convention.

### Updated Imports
- All relevant import statements across the codebase have been updated to reflect the new structure and naming.

### Engine Refactor
- Removed the abstract `search_by_content` method from `SQLiteEngine` and `DuckDBEngine`.
- Integrated search functionality into the [search_by_string](cci:1://file:///mcard/model/card_collection.py:94:4-96:82) method, allowing searches across content, hash, and g_time fields.

### Event Generation
- Updated [generate_duplication_event](cci:1://file:///mcard/model/event_producer.py:38:0-54:28) and [generate_collision_event](cci:1://file:///mcard/model/event_producer.py:57:0-76:38) to return JSON strings.
- Enhanced event structure to include upgraded hash functions and content size.

### Logging
- Integrated logging into test cases for better traceability and debugging.

### MCard Class Update
- The [MCard](cci:2://file:///mcard/model/card.py:6:0-47:9) constructor now accepts a [hash_function](cci:1://file:///mcard/model/event_producer.py:8:0-23:16) parameter, providing more flexibility in hash generation.

### Tests
- Adjusted tests to verify the new event generation logic and ensure search functionality works as intended.

## Centralized Configuration Management

### Overview
MCard has adopted a centralized configuration management approach to improve maintainability, scalability, and readability. This involves consolidating all configuration constants into a single location, making it easier to manage and update configuration values across the application.

### Configuration Constants
All configuration constants are now defined in `config_constants.py`. This file contains named constants for various configuration values, including:

- Database schema and paths
- Hash algorithm constants and hierarchy
- Environment variable names
- API configuration
- HTTP status codes
- Error messages
- Event types and structure

### Benefits
Centralized configuration management provides several benefits, including:

- **Single Source of Truth**: All configuration constants are managed in one location.
- **Type Safety**: Constants are properly typed and documented.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to configuration values only need to be made in one place.
- **Code Completion**: IDE support for constant names improves developer productivity.
- **Documentation**: Each constant group is documented with its purpose and usage.
- **Testing**: Test files use the same constants as production code, ensuring consistency.

### Implementation
The `config_constants.py` file uses an enum-based approach for hash algorithms, ensuring type safety and readability. The file is organized into logical groups, making it easier to find and update specific configuration values.

### Example Usage
To use a configuration constant, simply import the `config_constants` module and access the desired constant. For example:
```python
from config_constants import HASH_ALGORITHM_SHA256

# Use the SHA-256 hash algorithm
hash_algorithm = HASH_ALGORITHM_SHA256
```
By adopting a centralized configuration management approach, MCard has improved its maintainability, scalability, and readability, making it easier to manage and update configuration values across the application.

## Using MCardFromData for Stored Values

When retrieving stored MCard data from the database, always use the subclass `MCardFromData`. This approach allows you to bypass unnecessary and unwanted algorithms, significantly speeding up the MCard instantiation process.

```
## Configuration
### Environment Setup
Create a .env file with the following variables:

```plaintext
MCARD_DB_PATH=data/db/mcard_demo.db
TEST_DB_PATH=data/db/test_mcard.db
MCARD_SERVICE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
 ```

## Development Guidelines
### Using MCardFromData
When retrieving stored data, use MCardFromData instead of the base MCard class:

```python
from mcard.model.card import MCardFromData

stored_card = MCardFromData(content=content, hash=hash, g_time=g_time)
 ```

### Hash Algorithm Configuration
The default hash algorithm is SHA-256, but it's configurable:
```python
from mcard.algorithms import HASH_ALGORITHM_SHA256
 ```

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. Configure your environment:
   - Copy `.env.example` to create your own `.env` file.
   - The default configuration uses:
     - Database path: `data/db/mcard_demo.db`.
     - Hash algorithm: SHA-256.
     - Connection pool size: 5.
     - Connection timeout: 30 seconds.

## Directory Structure

- **mcard/**
  - **engine/**: Contains the database engine implementations, currently only SQLite.
  - **model/**: Contains the core data models, including `MCard`.
  - **tests/**: Contains all test cases for the MCard library, ensuring functionality and correctness.

## SQLite Persistence Testing

- **tests/persistence/sqlite_test.py**: Contains test cases for SQLite persistence, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

The tests in `@test_sqlite_persistence.py` are designed to clear the database after each test function is run. This means that the `test_mcard.db` file will only contain the data from the last test executed. If the `clear()` function in the fixture is uncommented, it will remove the content of the last test as well. This behavior is intended to ensure that each test starts with a clean database, allowing for more accurate and reliable testing results.
