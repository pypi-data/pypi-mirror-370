> *"I spent 25 years mastering technology, then realized my resume still looked like it was made in 1995. So I fixed that."* - Chris, probably

## üöÄ What The Hell Is This?

Resumate is a Python-powered resume generator that treats your career like the engineering project it deserves to be. No more fighting with Word margins at 2 AM. No more "why did my bullet points just explode?" Just clean YAML in, gorgeous PDF out.

Built by someone who:
- ‚úÖ Automated 20,000+ VMs
- ‚úÖ Managed enterprise infrastructure  
- ‚úÖ **Physically mails resumes to executives** (yes, in 2025)
- ‚ùå Refused to manually format another resume ever again

## ‚ú® Features That Actually Matter

- **YAML-Powered**: Your resume data in clean, version-controllable YAML
- **Template Engine**: Multiple templates from classic to "wow, how'd you do that?"
- **Skill Ratings**: Visual skill bars because lists are boring
- **Icon Support**: 2000+ tech icons built-in, plus use ANY custom SVG
- **QR Codes**: For when you want to be *that* person (in a good way)
- **Two-Page Support**: Different layouts for page 1 and continuation pages
- **CI/CD Ready**: Generate resumes in your pipeline because why not?

## üéØ Who Is This For?

- Engineers who version control everything (including their breakfast)
- People who think "just update your LinkedIn" is not a real answer
- Anyone who's ever lost formatting after saving a Word doc as PDF
- Folks who believe their resume should be as well-engineered as their code

  skills:
  - name: Python
    svg: python      # Just use the name - we'll find the icon
    rating: 5
  - name: JavaScript
    svg: javascript  # 2000+ icons built-in
    rating: 4
  - name: Internal Tool

    rating: 3
```

## üé® Icons - Built-in and Bring Your Own

### 2000+ Icons Included (Under 60MB!)

We bundle **Font Awesome** and **Simple Icons** so you get instant access to virtually every tech logo and icon you need. Just use the name:

```yaml
skills:
- name: Docker
  svg: docker       # Finds Docker logo automatically
- name: Kubernetes
  svg: kubernetes   # Finds K8s logo
- name: Team Lead
  svg: users        # Font Awesome icons work too
```

### Custom Icons? Just Drop The Path!

Got a special icon? Company logo? That perfect SVG you found? **Just use the file path**:

```yaml
- name: Secret Project
  svg: ./my-icons/classified.svg           # Relative path
- name: Corporate Tool
  svg: /home/user/company/tool-icon.svg   # Absolute path
- name: FluentUI Icon
  svg: /opt/fluentui/assets/Trophy/SVG/ic_fluent_trophy_32_filled.svg
```

### Why Not FluentUI By Default?

We love FluentUI's colorful icons, but they're **several hundred MB**. We chose Font Awesome + Simple Icons to keep the package lean. But if you want those pretty FluentUI icons, just clone them and reference the paths!

### How Icon Resolution Works

When you write `svg: something`, Resumate searches in order:
1. **File exists?** ‚Üí Uses it
2. **In DevIcons?** ‚Üí Uses it
3. **In Simple Icons?** ‚Üí Uses it  
4. **In Font Awesome?** ‚Üí Uses it
5. **Can't find it?** ‚Üí Logs warning, continues

## üé® Templates

### Built-in Templates

- **Classic**: Professional two-column with header image
- **Minimal**: For when less is more
- **Tech**: Icon-heavy for the tech crowd
- **Executive**: When you need to look expensive

### Custom Templates

Templates are just YAML files. Make your own! Add comic sans if you dare! We won't judge (much).

## üî• Advanced Features

### Skill Ratings with Icons

```yaml
skills:
- category: Cloud Juggling
  skills:
  - name: AWS
    svg: amazonwebservices  # or just 'aws'
    rating: 5  # I dream in CloudFormation
  - name: Azure
    svg: azure  
    rating: 3  # When the client insists
  - name: Our Platform
    svg: ./company/platform-logo.svg  # Custom icon
    rating: 5
```

### Dynamic QR Codes

```yaml
# Embed your LinkedIn, GitHub, or Rick Astley
qr_codes:
  linkedin: https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile
  github: https://github.com/yourusername
  secret: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```
