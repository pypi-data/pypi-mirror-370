  - |
    The ``--class`` options of the ``quota show`` command, which was deprecated
    in 6.1.0 (Antelope), has now been removed in favour of the ``--default``
    option. Quota classes were never fully implemented and the compute and
    volume services only support a single ``default`` quota class while the
    network service does not support quota classes at all.
