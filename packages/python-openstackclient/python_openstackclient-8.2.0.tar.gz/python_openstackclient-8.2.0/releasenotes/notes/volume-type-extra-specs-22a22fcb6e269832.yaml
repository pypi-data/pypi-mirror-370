    The ``volume type create``, ``volume type set``, ``volume type list``
    commands now accept four new options - ``--multiattach``, ``--cacheable``,
    ``--replicated``, and ``--availability-zone`` - which are short cuts for
    setting or filtering on the relevant properties on the volume type.
