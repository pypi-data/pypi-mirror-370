    Support for the Block Storage (Cinder) v1 API has been officially removed
    as it had been broken for some time. If you haven't noticed then you likely
    don't need to do anything. However, in the unlikely event that your cloud
    is using the Block Storage v1 API - or incorrectly advertises the Block
    Storage v1 API - consider overriding the API version to use v2 as this
    behaves very similarly. It may also be necessary to set an endpoint
    override for the Block Storage API if your clouds service catalog is not
    configured correctly. For example:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        example:
          regions:
            - name: regionOne
              values:
                block_storage_endpoint_override: 'https://blockstorage.api.cloud.example/'
          volume_api_version: 2

    If using a public cloud provider, there may also be a profile already
    published that sets these. These are listed in the `Vendor Support`__
    doc. For example:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        example:
          profile: rackspace

    Alternatively, consider use versions of OSC < 3.19 and python-cinderclient
    < 5.0 (both Stein), since these were the last versions to fully support
    Cinder v1.
