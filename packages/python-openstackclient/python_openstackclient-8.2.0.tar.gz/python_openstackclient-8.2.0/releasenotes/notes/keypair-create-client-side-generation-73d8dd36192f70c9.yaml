    The ``openstack keypair create`` command will now generate keypairs on the
    client side in ssh-ed25519 format. The Compute service no longer supports
    server-side key generation starting with ``--os-compute-api-version 2.92``
    while the use of ssh-ed25519 is necessary as support for ssh-rsa has been
    disabled by default starting in OpenSSH 8.8, which prevents its use in
    guests using this version of OpenSSH in the default configuration.
    ssh-ed25519 support is widespread and is supported by OpenSSH 6.5 or later
    and Dropbear 2020.79 or later.
