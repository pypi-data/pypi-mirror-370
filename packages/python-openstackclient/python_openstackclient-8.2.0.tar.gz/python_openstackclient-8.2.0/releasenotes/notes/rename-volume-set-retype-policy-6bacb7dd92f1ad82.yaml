    The ``volume set --retype-policy`` parameter has been renamed to
    ``--migration-policy`` to better convey the correct meaning of the options
    usage. The migration policy determines whether we are going to perform the
    migration in the retype opearation or not and is not related to the actual
    retype which just changes the volume type of the volume.
