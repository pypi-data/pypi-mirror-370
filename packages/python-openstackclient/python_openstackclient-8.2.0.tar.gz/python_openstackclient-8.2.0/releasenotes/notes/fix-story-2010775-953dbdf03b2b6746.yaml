    Fixed a bug in "access rule" subcommands where the client logic incorrectly
    assumed that access rules have a "name" property which resulted in
    unpredictable behaviors.  e.g. "access rule delete {non-existent-id}" now
    results in a not-found error instead of sometimes deleting an unrelated
    rule.
