features:
  - |
    ``openstack server rebuild`` command now fails early if the server is
    not in a state supported for rebuild - either ``ACTIVE``, ``ERROR`` or
    ``SHUTOFF``.
    See `OpenStack Compute API reference for server rebuild action
    <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/?expanded=rebuild-server-rebuild-action-detail#rebuild-server-rebuild-action>`_.
fixes:
  - |
    ``openstack server rebuild --wait`` now properly works for servers in
    ``SHUTOFF`` state without hanging.
