# Provider { #chatlas.Provider }

```python
Provider()
```

A model provider interface for a [](`~chatlas.Chat`).

This abstract class defines the interface a model provider must implement in
order to be used with a [](`~chatlas.Chat`) instance. The provider is
responsible for performing the actual chat completion, and for handling the
streaming of the completion results.

Note that this class is exposed for developers who wish to implement their
own provider. In general, you should not need to interact with this class
directly.
