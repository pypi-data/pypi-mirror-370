# types.ChatResponse { #chatlas.types.ChatResponse }

```python
types.ChatResponse(generator)
```

Chat response object.

An object that, when displayed, will simulatenously consume (if not
already consumed) and display the response in a streaming fashion.

This is useful for interactive use: if the object is displayed, it can
be viewed as it is being generated. And, if the object is not displayed,
it can act like an iterator that can be consumed by something else.
