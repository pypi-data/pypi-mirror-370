# HTML FOR DOCX
![Tests](https://github.com/dfop02/html4docx/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/html-for-docx.svg)
![Supported Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/html-for-docx.svg)

Convert html to docx, this project is a fork from descontinued [pqzx/html2docx](https://github.com/pqzx/html2docx).

## How install

`pip install html-for-docx`

## Usage

#### The basic usage

Add HTML formatted to an existing Docx

```python
from html4docx import HtmlToDocx

parser = HtmlToDocx()
html_string = '<h1>Hello world</h1>'
parser.add_html_to_document(html_string, filename_docx)
```

You can use `python-docx` to manipulate the file as well, here an example

```python
from docx import Document
from html4docx import HtmlToDocx

document = Document()
new_parser = HtmlToDocx()

html_string = '<h1>Hello world</h1>'
new_parser.add_html_to_document(html_string, document)

document.save('your_file_name.docx')
```

#### Convert files directly

```python
from html4docx import HtmlToDocx

new_parser = HtmlToDocx()
new_parser.parse_html_file(input_html_file_path, output_docx_file_path)
# You can also define a encoding, by default is utf-8
new_parser.parse_html_file(input_html_file_path, output_docx_file_path, 'utf-8')
```

#### Convert files from a string

```python
from html4docx import HtmlToDocx

new_parser = HtmlToDocx()
docx = new_parser.parse_html_string(input_html_file_string)
```

#### Change table styles

Tables are not styled by default. Use the `table_style` attribute on the parser to set a table style before convert html. The style is used for all tables.

```python
from html4docx import HtmlToDocx

new_parser = HtmlToDocx()
new_parser.table_style = 'Light Shading Accent 4'
docx = new_parser.parse_html_string(input_html_file_string)
```

To add borders to tables, use the `Table Grid` style:

```python
new_parser.table_style = 'Table Grid'
```

All table styles we support can be found [here](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/styles-understanding.html#table-styles-in-default-template).

#### Metadata

You're able to read or set docx metadata:

```python
from docx import Document
from html4docx import HtmlToDocx

document = Document()
new_parser = HtmlToDocx()
new_parser.set_initial_attrs(document)
metadata = new_parser.metadata

# You can get metadata as dict
metadata_json = metadata.get_metadata()
print(metadata_json['author']) # Jane
# or just print all metadata if if you want
metadata.get_metadata(print_result=True)

# Set new metadata
metadata.set_metadata(author="Jane", created="2025-07-18T09:30:00")
document.save('your_file_name.docx')
```

You can find all available metadata attributes [here](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/analysis/features/coreprops.html).

### Why

My goal in forking and fixing/updating this package was to complete my current task at work, which involves converting HTML to DOCX. The original package lacked a few features and had some bugs, preventing me from completing the task. Instead of creating a new package from scratch, I preferred to update this one.

## Known Issues

- **Maximum Nesting Depth:** Ordered lists support up to 3 nested levels. Any additional depth beyond level 3 will be treated as level 3.
- **Counter Reset Behavior:**
  - At level 1, starting a new ordered list will reset the counter.
  - At levels 2 and 3, the counter will continue from the previous item unless explicitly reset.

## Project Guidelines

This project is primarily designed for compatibility with Microsoft Word, but it currently works well with LibreOffice and Google Docs, based on our testing. The goal is to maintain this cross-platform harmony while continuing to implement fixes and updates.

> ⚠️ However, please note that Microsoft Word is the priority. Bugs or issues specific to other editors (e.g., LibreOffice or Google Docs) may be considered, but fixing them is secondary to maintaining full compatibility with Word.
