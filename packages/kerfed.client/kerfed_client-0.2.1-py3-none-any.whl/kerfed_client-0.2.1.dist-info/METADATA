# kerfed.client

A client for the Kerfed Engine which reliably analyzes 2D or 3D CAD geometry into a well-defined data structure. It can be used for many applications, including e-commerce, robotic automation, and process analysis.

Check out an API demo which converts a mesh into a full milling plan with G-code at [CarveWizard](https://carvewizard.com).

### Install

```
pip install kerfed.client
```

### Quick Start

```python
import os
import kerfed.client as ke

if __name__ == "__main__":

   # create a client using a free tier API key
   # requests may be rate limited, de-scoped, and run on slower hardware 
    client = ke.EngineClient(api_key="kerfed_limited_access")


    # Generate a GeometryRequest
    file_name = "tray.stl.zip"
    with open(file_name, "rb") as f:
        request = ke.GeometryRequest(
            source=ke.FileBlob(
                name=file_name,
                data=f.read(),
            ),
            source_units="inches",
        )

    # Start the geometry request running in the cloud.
    task_id = client.geometry_start(request, upload=True)

    # This will either return a `GeometryReponse` or raise an error.
    response = client.geometry_result(task_id=task_id)
```
