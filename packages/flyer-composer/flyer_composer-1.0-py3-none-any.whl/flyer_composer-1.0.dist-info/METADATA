`Flyer Composer` can be used to prepare one- or two-sided flyers for
printing on one sheet of paper.

Imagine you have designed a flyer in A6 format and want to print it using your
A4 printer. Of course, you want to print four flyers on each sheet. This is
where `Flyer Composer` steps in, creating a PDF which holds your flyer
four times. If you have a second page, `Flyer Composer` can arrange it
the same way - even if the second page is in a separate PDF file.

This also work if your input file was designed for e.g. A2: it will simply be
scaled down to A6 and placed four times in the sheet. And, of course,  `PDF
Flyer Composer` supports other flyer sizes or paper sizes, too.

This is much like `pdfnup` (or `psnup`), except that the *same* page is
put the paper several times.

`Flyer Composer` contains two programs: a Qt-based GUI one
(`flyer-composer-gui`) and a command line one (`flyer-composer`).

For more information please refer to the manpage or visit
the `project homepage <http://crazy-compilers.com/flyer-composer>`_.
