<!-- **`enhance-this`** is a powerful and reliable command-line tool designed to elevate your prompts for AI models. It takes your initial ideas, enhances them into rich and specific instructions using local AI models (Ollama), and then instantly copies the refined prompt to your clipboard. It acts as your personal prompt engineering assistant, running directly on your computer. -->

## üöÄ What is `enhance-this`?

At its core, `enhance-this` helps you achieve superior results from AI. By transforming your basic input into a comprehensive, well-structured prompt, it ensures the AI understands your intent precisely. This leads to higher quality and more useful responses, all powered by AI models running locally on your machine for speed and privacy.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Live Streaming Output**: Witness your prompt being crafted in real-time, character by character, directly in your terminal.
-   **Flexible Enhancement Styles**: Choose from predefined styles (like `detailed`, `creative`, or `technical`) to tailor your prompt's output. This allows you to guide the AI precisely for your needs.
-   **Customizable Templates**: Define and use your own prompt enhancement templates, allowing for highly personalized AI interactions.
-   **Diff View**: Easily compare your original prompt with the enhanced version using a clear, color-coded diff display.
-   **Local Ollama Integration**: Seamlessly connect with your local Ollama instance to leverage powerful AI models directly on your machine, ensuring fast responses and data privacy.
-   **Intelligent Model Management**:
    -   Automatically detects running Ollama instances and available models.
    -   Automatically selects an optimal AI model if not specified.
    -   Facilitates model downloads: If a recommended model is missing, `enhance-this` can download it for you with progress indication.
    -   Resilient Network Handling: Includes retry logic for network requests to ensure robust communication.
-   **Automated Setup**: A single command (`enhance --auto-setup`) can automatically configure Ollama with a recommended AI model.
-   **Rich Terminal Output**: Utilizes `rich` for clear, color-coded, and well-formatted terminal output, including markdown rendering.
-   **Clipboard Integration**: Automatically copies the enhanced prompt to your system's clipboard for immediate use.
-   **Highly Configurable**: Customize behavior through a simple YAML configuration file, controlling aspects like model creativity and prompt enhancement logic.
