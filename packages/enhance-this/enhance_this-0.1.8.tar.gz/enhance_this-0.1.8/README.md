## üí° How to Use `enhance-this`

Using `enhance-this` is incredibly straightforward. Just tell it what you want to enhance!

**Basic Enhancement:**

```bash
enhance "write a blog post about AI"
# Output: "Create a comprehensive blog post about artificial intelligence that educates readers about current AI developments, applications, and implications. Structure the content with: an engaging introduction that hooks the reader, clear explanations of key AI concepts, real-world examples and case studies, discussion of both benefits and challenges, and actionable insights for the target audience. Ensure the tone is accessible to non-technical readers while maintaining accuracy and depth."
```

**Interactive Mode:**

```bash
enhance --interactive
```

**See the Magic with `--diff`:**

```bash
enhance "review my code" --diff
# Shows a side-by-side comparison of your original prompt and the new, improved version!
```

**Choose a Style:**

```bash
enhance "a logo for a coffee shop" -s creative
```

**View Your History:**

```bash
enhance --history
```

## üöÄ Performance Tips

To get the fastest response times, you can preload a model into your computer's memory. This keeps the model ready to go, so you don't have to wait for it to load every time.

**Preload a Model:**

```bash
enhance --preload-model
```

This will load the best available model into memory and keep it there. For the best performance, we recommend using a fast and capable model like `llama3.1:8b` or `mistral`.

You can also configure Ollama to keep models alive for a specific duration. See the Ollama documentation for more details on the `keep_alive` parameter in your Modelfiles.
