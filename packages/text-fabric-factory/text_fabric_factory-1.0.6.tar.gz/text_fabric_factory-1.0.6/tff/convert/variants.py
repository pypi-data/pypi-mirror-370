# Variants

This module contains functions to help you constructing nodes
when you convert TEI material and encounter elements from
the
[Critical Apparatus Module](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/examples-lem.html#TC).

An extensive description of the problems and solutions is in
`tf.about.variants`.

class Variants:
    def __init__(self, cv, cur, baseWitness, sentType, checkPunc, addWarning, addError):
        """Handlers to turn boundaries into nodes even across variants.

        This class works inside converters of the type `tf.convert.walker`.
        Import it as

        ``` python
        from tff.convert.variants import Variants
        ```

        It should typically be instantiated inside the `director()` function,
        at a point where `cv` and `cur` are known.

        Then issue `Variants.initApps`, either once or for each volume in the corpus.

        After initialization you should call `Variants.collectWitnesses()` for
        each TEI file in the corpus.

        After collecting the witnesses you should prepare for the final walk through
        the data by `Variants.resetApps()`. This should match the call(s) to
        `Variants.initApps`.

        Then, at the start of each `app`-, `lem`-, `rdg`- element, call
        `Variants.startApp(tag)` with tag the corresponding tag name (
        `app`, `lem`, or `rdg`).

        Likewise, at the end, call `Variants.endApp(tag)`.

        Whenever you create slots, issue a `Variants.startSent()` first,
        and a `Variants.checkSent()` after.

        Close every TEI file with a `Variants.endSent()`, to finish off all
        pending sentences.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cv: object
            The `tf.convert.walker.CV` object. This is the machinery that constructs
            nodes and assigns features.
        cur: dict
            Keys and values by which a conversion program maintains current information.
            The conversion proceeds by executing a custom `director()` function,
            and this director walks through the source material and fires `cv` actions.
            During the walk, the director can remember incoming data as needed in a
            dict, and it is this dict that should be passed. The `Variants` object
            stores additional information here under specific keys.

            Those keys are mentioned in constants in the source code and there are
            a few keys dependent on the `sentType` parameter, namely

                f"n{sentType}"
                f"stack{sentType}"
                f"var{sentType}"

        baseWitness: string
            The name of the base text. Take care that it is different from the names
            of the witnesses.

        sentType: string
            The name of the node type of the nodes that will be constructed on the
            basis of boundaries. It could be "sentence", but it could also be any
            other name, and it is not assumed that the nodes in question represent
            sentences. It could be anything, provided we have access to its boundaries.

        checkPunc: function(string, string, punc): boolean
            Given the texts of the last two slots and the punctuation after that,
            it determines whether is contains a boundary.
            This function should be written in the converter program.
            Hence it is up to the conversion code to define what constitutes a boundary,
            and whether it are sentences or some things else that are being bounded.
            This function is called and depending on the outcome sentence nodes are
            terminated and / or created, or nothing is done.

        addWarning, addError: function(string, dict)
            Functions taking a message string and a dict with current information
            (typically cur).
            They will be called if a warning or error has to be issued.
            When they is called, `cur` will be passed as dict.
            This function should be defined in the conversion program. It may use values
            in `cur` to generate an indication where the warning / error occurred.
