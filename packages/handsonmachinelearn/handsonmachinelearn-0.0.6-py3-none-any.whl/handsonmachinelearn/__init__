As a Data Science Manager at PGE-PR and a Ph.D. in Computational Modeling
at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF), I specialize in artificial
intelligence, focusing on the study, development, and application of machine learning
models, under the supervision of Prof. Eduardo Pestana de Aguiar. My academic journey 
includes a scholarship that allowed me to pursue a year of my Ph.D. at the 
University of Nottingham/UK, where I was a member of the LUCID
(Laboratory for Uncertainty in Data and Decision Making) under the 
supervision of Professor Christian Wagner. My background in Industrial
Engineering provides me with a holistic view of organizational processes,
enabling me to propose efficient solutions and reduce waste.
