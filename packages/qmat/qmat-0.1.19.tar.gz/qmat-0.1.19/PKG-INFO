`qmat` is a python package to generate matrix coefficients related to Collocation methods,
Spectral Deferred Corrections (SDC), and more generally for Runge-Kutta methods.

It allows to generate $Q$-coefficients for multi-stages methods (equivalent to Butcher tables) :

$$
Q\text{-coefficients : }
\begin{array}{c|c}
\tau & Q \\
\hline
& w^\top
\end{array}
\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
\begin{array}{c|c}
c & A \\
\hline
& b^\top
\end{array}
\quad\text{(Butcher table)}
$$

and many different **lower-triangular** approximations of the $Q$ matrix, named $Q_\Delta$,
which are key elements for Spectral Deferred Correction (SDC), or more general Iterated Runge-Kutta Methods.

## Installation

```bash
pip install qmat
```

🔍 See more [detailed instructions for conda environment, development, ...](https://qmat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

## Basic usage

📜 _If you are already familiar with those concepts, you can use this package like this :_

```python
from qmat import genQCoeffs, genQDeltaCoeffs

# Coefficients or specific collocation method
nodes, weights, Q = genQCoeffs(
    "Collocation", nNodes=4, nodeType="LEGENDRE", quadType="RADAU-RIGHT")

# QDelta matrix from Implicit-Euler based SDC
QDelta = genQDeltaCoeffs("IE", nodes=nodes)

# Butcher table of the classical explicit RK4 method
c, b, A = genQCoeffs("ERK4")
```

> 🔔 _If you are not familiar with SDC or related methods, and want to learn more about it, checkout the
> [latest documentation build](https://qmat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
in particular the [**step by step notebook tutorials**](https://qmat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks.html)_

For any contribution, please checkout out (very cool) [Contribution Guidelines](https://qmat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)
and the current [Development Roadmap](https://qmat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devdoc/roadmap.html).
