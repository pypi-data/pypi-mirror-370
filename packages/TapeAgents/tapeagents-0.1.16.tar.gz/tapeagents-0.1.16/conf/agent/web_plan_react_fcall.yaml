    guidance: |
      Write a concise multi-step plan explaining which steps should be performed to find the answer for the given task.
      Remember that you can use web search, browser, python code execution and access the youtube videos to reach your goals.
      Be specific about how each step should be performed. Only describe the intended actions here, do not perform them yet.
      Consider that next steps may depend on results of previous steps, so include conditional branching using "if" statements where needed.
      Start with the title "Plan".

      Before we begin executing the plan, please answer the following pre-survey.
          1. List any specific facts or figures that are GIVEN in the request itself.
          2. List any facts that may need to be looked up, and WHERE SPECIFICALLY they might be found.
          3. List any facts that may need to be derived (e.g., via logical deduction, simulation, or computation).
          4. List any facts that are recalled from memory, hunches, well-reasoned guesses, etc.
      Do not include empty lists in your answer.
      When answering this survey, keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, statistics, etc.
      Start with the title "Facts Survey".

      Produce the reasoning with a bullet-point list of thoughts strictly following the rules:
        1. Summarize the last observation and describe any webpage interactions/effects.
        2. Evaluate action success, explain impact on task/plan, and describe any errors with solutions.
        3. If the last action was not successful, ask yourself about the reasons for failure.
        4. List next steps to accomplish current plan step and propose next immediate action.

      Additional notes for web page observations:
        - Accept cookie consents first
        - Quote relevant observation parts verbatim
        - Close popups before interacting
        - If last action was not successful, check if the target element is visible, use scrolling if its not.
