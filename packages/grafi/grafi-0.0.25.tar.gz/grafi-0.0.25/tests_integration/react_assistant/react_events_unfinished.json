Generally, the eastern front of the Rockies reaches significant heights, often ranging from around 5,000 feet to over 14,000 feet at the highest peaks, such as Mount Elbert.\\n\\nOnce I retrieve that specific data, I can provide a precise elevation range for the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny.
