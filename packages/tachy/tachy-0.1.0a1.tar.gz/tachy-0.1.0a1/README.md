## About

**Stormy** is an open-source Python library that detects hateful or offensive language. Stormy models are trained to predict toxic comments on the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification challenge. Unlike traditional keyword-based approaches, Stormy leverages advanced natural language processing to understand context and nuance, providing more accurate and fair toxicity detection.

**Stormy** is designed to help maintain healthy and positive online environments by identifying and handling inappropriate messages in real-time, with customizable rules and actionable analytics.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Detection**: Fine-tuned BERT models for accurate toxicity detection.
- ‚ö° **Real-time Analysis**: Instant text analysis for toxicity and offensive language.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Customizable Thresholds**: Configure detection thresholds and actions.
- üìä **Analytics Tools**: Track moderation metrics and analyze text datasets.
- üîå **API-Ready**: Easily integrate toxicity detection into your own Python applications.
