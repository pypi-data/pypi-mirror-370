    A context manager to log the duration and outcome of a block of code.

    It automatically captures the start time, executes the wrapped code block,
    and then logs an event including the duration, outcome (success/error),
    and any initial or error-specific key-value pairs.

    Args:
        logger_instance: The PyviderLogger instance to use for logging.
        event_name: A descriptive name for the event/operation being timed.
        layer_keys: Optional dictionary of pre-defined semantic keys relevant to
                    active telemetry layers (e.g., {"llm.task": "generation"}).
                    These are merged with initial_kvs.
        **initial_kvs: Additional key-value pairs to include in the log entry
                       from the start of the block.

    Example:
        ```python
        from pyvider.telemetry import logger
        from pyvider.telemetry.utils import timed_block

        with timed_block(logger, "database_query", db_operation="select_user", db_table="users"):
            # ... code to execute database query ...
            if error_condition:
                raise ValueError("Simulated DB error")
