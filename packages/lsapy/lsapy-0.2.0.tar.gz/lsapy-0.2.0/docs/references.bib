  abstract = {Under climate change, land use suitability for horticultural production will
    change; this has prospects of both adverse socio-economic impacts for the industry in
    some regions, and beneficial impacts in others. Policy development and industry
    guidance are needed to develop adaptations to mitigate climate change risks and exploit
    new opportunities. For climate-change issues, models provide a powerful means for
    assessing future suitability at a patch, region or national scale in order to guide
    policy decisions. Here, we describe the development of a new continuous (sliding-scale)
    suitability modelling approach to assess the suitability of different locations for
    growing apple and kiwifruit in New Zealand, based on phenological and physiological
    considerations; these models used geographical information system (GIS) soil, land and
    weather data to develop maps showing the suitability of locations across New Zealand
    for cultivating apple and kiwifruit. The models were ``ground-truthed'' in an iterative
    process of expert parameterisation and recalibration to ensure maps aligned with
    current growing locations for the two crops. We estimated an econometric logit model
    that incorporated the continuous suitability scores as predictors of land use for apple
    and kiwifruit. Comparison of modelled suitability scores with industry-supplied maps of
    apple and kiwifruit orchards showed good consistency between predicted suitability and
    current land use. Compared with a range of alternative land uses, suitability for apple
    was highest for locations currently used to grow apple and suitability for kiwifruit
    was highest for locations currently used to grow kiwifruit. Our framework provides the
    capability to project incremental changes in the suitability of locations for apple and
    kiwifruit under different climate change pathways and to project consequential changes
    in their spatial footprints; this framework can be extended to other crops.},

  abstract = {Regional suitability for growing avocados and blueberries may alter with
    climate change. Modelling can provide insights into potential climate change impacts,
    thereby informing industry and government policy decisions to ameliorate future risks
    and capitalise on future opportunities. We developed continuous/sliding-scale models
    that used soil, terrain and weather data to assess location suitability for cultivating
    avocado and blueberry, based on physiological and phenological considerations specific
    to each crop. Using geographical information system (GIS) data on soil, slope and
    weather, we mapped cultivation suitability for avocado and blueberry across New
    Zealand, and, for accuracy, ``ground-truthed'' these maps in an iterative process of
    expert validation and model recalibration. We modelled the incremental changes in
    location suitability that could occur through climate change using ``future'' GIS-based
    weather data from climate model simulations for different greenhouse gas (GHG) pathways
    that ranged from stringent GHG mitigation to unabated GHG emissions. Changes in maps
    over time showed where suitability would increase or decrease and to what extent. These
    results indicate where avocado and blueberry might replace other crops that become less
    suitable over time, and where avocado might displace blueberry. The approach and models
    can be applied to other countries or extended to other crops with similar growing
    requirements.},
