.. MicroPie documentation master file, created for the MicroPie ASGI framework.

MicroPie ASGI Web Framework
===========================

MicroPie is a small, asynchronous web framework built on top of the
ASGI specification.  It is designed to be simple to learn and easy to
extend while still providing the features necessary to build modern web
applications.  MicroPie offers automatic URL routing, pluggable
session back‑ends, middleware hooks, WebSocket support and optional
template rendering.  Its focus on minimalism makes it a good choice for
lightweight services, APIs and educational projects.

This documentation is organized according to the
Diátaxis documentation framework. That framework separates documentation into
four distinct types:

* **Tutorials** – step‑by‑step introductions that teach you how to
  accomplish a task.  Tutorials should avoid deep explanations and help
  you get started quickly.
* **How‑to guides** – recipes focused on solving a particular problem.
  Guides assume you already know the basics and want to apply MicroPie
  to a concrete task.
* **Reference** – authoritative descriptions of classes, functions and
  modules.  These documents are factual and concise.
* **Explanation** – discussions that explore the rationale behind
  design choices and deeper concepts in MicroPie.

In addition to these four types, a small glossary collects
terminology used throughout the framework.  If you are new to
MicroPie, start with the tutorial.  If you want to accomplish a
specific task, head to the how‑to guides.  If you need to look up a
particular method or class, consult the reference manual.  For
background and design considerations, see the explanation section.
