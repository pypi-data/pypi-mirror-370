# Claude MPM - Multi-Agent Project Manager

A powerful orchestration framework for Claude Code that enables multi-agent workflows, session management, and real-time monitoring through an intuitive interface.

> **Quick Start**: See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) to get running in 5 minutes!

## Features

- 🤖 **Multi-Agent System**: Automatically delegates tasks to specialized agents (PM, Research, Engineer, QA, Documentation, Security, Ops, Data Engineer, Test Integration, Version Control)
- 🧠 **Agent Memory System**: Persistent learning with project-specific knowledge retention
- 🔄 **Session Management**: Resume previous sessions with `--resume` 
- 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live dashboard with `--monitor` flag
- 🛡️ **Memory Guardian (Experimental)**: Automatic memory monitoring and intelligent restarts to prevent crashes
- 📁 **Multi-Project Support**: Per-session working directories
- 🔍 **Git Integration**: View diffs and track changes across projects
- 🎯 **Smart Task Orchestration**: PM agent intelligently routes work to specialists

## Quick Installation

```bash
pip install claude-mpm
```

**That's it!** See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for immediate usage or [docs/user/installation.md](docs/user/installation.md) for advanced options.

## Quick Usage

```bash
# Start interactive mode (recommended)
claude-mpm

# Start with monitoring dashboard
claude-mpm run --monitor

# Start with memory protection (prevents crashes from large conversations)
claude-mpm run-guarded
```

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for complete usage examples.


## Architecture

Claude MPM v3.8.2+ features a **modern service-oriented architecture** with interface-based design, dependency injection, and intelligent caching for 50-80% performance improvements.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture information.

## Key Capabilities

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
The PM agent automatically delegates work to specialized agents including Research, Engineer, QA, Documentation, Security, Ops, Data Engineer, Test Integration, and Version Control.

### Agent Memory System
Agents learn project-specific patterns and remember insights across sessions. Initialize with `claude-mpm memory init`.

### Memory Guardian System (Experimental)
**⚠️ Beta Feature** - Prevents memory-related crashes through intelligent monitoring and automatic restarts with state preservation.

```bash
# Start with memory protection (recommended for long sessions)
claude-mpm run-guarded --accept-experimental

# Custom memory threshold for your system
claude-mpm run-guarded --memory-threshold 16000 --accept-experimental  # 16GB
```

**Why Memory Guardian?** Large conversation histories can consume 2GB+ of memory, causing system instability. The Memory Guardian monitors memory usage and performs controlled restarts while preserving your conversation context and work progress.

**Note:** This is an experimental feature in beta. Use `--accept-experimental` to suppress warnings.

### Real-Time Monitoring
The `--monitor` flag opens a web dashboard showing live agent activity, file operations, and session management.

See [docs/MEMORY.md](docs/MEMORY.md), [docs/USER_GUIDE_MEMORY_GUARDIAN.md](docs/USER_GUIDE_MEMORY_GUARDIAN.md), and [docs/developer/11-dashboard/README.md](docs/developer/11-dashboard/README.md) for details.

## Development

### Quick Development Setup
```bash
# Complete development setup with code formatting and quality tools
make dev-complete

# Or step by step:
make setup-dev          # Install in development mode
make setup-pre-commit    # Set up automated code formatting
```

### Code Quality & Formatting
The project uses automated code formatting and quality checks:
- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking
- **Pre-commit hooks** for automatic enforcement

See [docs/developer/CODE_FORMATTING.md](docs/developer/CODE_FORMATTING.md) for details.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please see our [project structure guide](docs/STRUCTURE.md) and follow the established patterns.

**Development Workflow**:
1. Run `make dev-complete` to set up your environment
2. Code formatting happens automatically on commit
3. All code must pass quality checks before merging
