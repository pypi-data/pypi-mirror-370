    We no longer recommend using the eventlet unsafe keystonemiddleware's
    memcacheclientpool. This implementation may result in growing connections
    to memcached.

    It is recommended that the ``memcache_use_advanced_pool`` option
    is set to ``True`` in the ``keystone_authtoken`` configuration section of
    the various services (e.g. nova, glance, ...) when memcached is used for
    token cache.

    Keystonemiddleware now using eventlet-safe implementation of
    ``MemcacheClientPool`` from oslo.cache's library by default.
    The ``keystonemiddleware`` implementation is now deprecated. For backwards
    compatibility, the ``[keystone_authtoken] memcache_use_advanced_pool``
    option can be set to ``False`` config files of the various services (e.g.
    nova, glance, ...) when memcached is used for token cache.
