### Changed
- **Breaking Change**: Status field is now required for all tickets

### Fixed
- Fixed status validation to ensure only valid states are accepted

2. Tickets with invalid status → status set to OPEN  
3. Terminal states without resolution → resolution set to status value
4. Comments without status → inherit from parent ticket
