PyACTUp is a lightweight Python implementation of a subset of the
ACT-R cognitive architecture’s Declarative Memory, suitable for
incorporating into other Python models and applications. Its design
is inspired by the ACT-UP cognitive modeling toolbox.

There is [online documentation of PyACTUp](http://koalemos.psy.cmu.edu/pyactup/),
and the [sources](https://github.com/dfmorrison/pyactup/) are on GitHub.

The latest version of PyACTUp can be download and installed from PyPi with pip:

    pip install pyactup

Use of a virtual environment for Python, such as venv or Anaconda is recommended.

PyACTUp requires Python version 3.8 or later.
