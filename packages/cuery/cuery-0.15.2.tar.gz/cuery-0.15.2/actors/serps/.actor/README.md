- ‚úÖ Use exact brand names as they appear in search results
- ‚úÖ Check spelling and capitalization of brand names
- ‚úÖ Try both short names ("Nike") and full names ("Nike Inc.")
- ‚úÖ Ensure brands actually appear in the search results

**"AI analysis taking too long"**
- ‚úÖ Reduce `topic_max_samples` to 100-300 for faster processing
- ‚úÖ Use fewer keywords per batch (20-50 instead of 100+)
- ‚úÖ Consider disabling AI models if not needed
- ‚úÖ Try lighter models like "openai/gpt-4.1-mini"

**"Geographic targeting not working"**
- ‚úÖ Use standard country codes: `"us"`, `"uk"`, `"de"`, etc.
- ‚úÖ Match language with country when possible
- ‚úÖ Check that the combination is supported by Google Search
- ‚úÖ Try common combinations like `"us"` + `"en"` first

**"Too many paid results, not enough organic"**
- ‚úÖ Try less commercial keywords for more organic results

**"Entity extraction from AI overviews failing"**
- ‚úÖ Ensure AI overviews are present in your results first
- ‚úÖ Check that `entity_model` is set correctly
- ‚úÖ Try different AI models if extraction is inconsistent
