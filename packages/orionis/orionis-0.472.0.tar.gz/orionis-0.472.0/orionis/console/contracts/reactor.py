        Executes a command by its signature with optional command-line arguments.

        This method retrieves a registered command by its signature, validates any provided
        arguments against the command's argument parser, and executes the command's handle
        method with the parsed arguments and application context.

        Parameters
        ----------
        signature : str
            The unique signature identifier of the command to execute.
        args : Optional[List[str]], default None
            Command-line arguments to pass to the command. If None, no arguments are provided.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. The command's handle method is called
            directly for execution.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the command with the specified signature is not found in the registry.
        SystemExit
            If argument parsing fails due to invalid arguments provided.

        Retrieves a list of all registered commands with their metadata.

        This method returns a list of dictionaries, each containing information about
        a registered command, including its signature, description, and whether it has
        timestamps enabled. This is useful for introspection and displaying available
        commands to the user.

        Returns
        -------
        List[dict]
            A list of dictionaries representing the registered commands, where each dictionary
            contains the command's signature, description, and timestamps status.
