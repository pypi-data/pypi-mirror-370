A Python implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using Pygame.

## Overview

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Pygame. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their marks (_X_ or _O_) in the empty cells of the grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The game checks for winning conditions after each move and displays the result on the screen.

## Features

- Two-player mode.
- Simple and intuitive interface.
- Win detection and draw handling.
- Pygame graphics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher.
- Pygame library.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install tic-tac-toe-pygame
```

## Usage

To run the game, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m tic_tac_toe_pygame
```

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their marks (_X_ or _O_) in the empty cells.
- The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

1. Start the game by running the command above.
2. The game window will open displaying a 3x3 grid.
3. Players take turns clicking on the empty cells to place their marks.
4. The game will announce the winner or if the game ends in a draw.
