Generate Looker view files automatically from dbt models in BigQuery. Tested with dbt v1.8, capable of generating 2800+ views in roughly 6 seconds.

## Overview

`dbt2lookml` bridges the gap between dbt and Looker by automatically generating LookML views from your dbt models. It's particularly valuable for:

- Large data teams managing numerous models
- Complex data models with many relationships
- Teams wanting to automate their Looker view generation
- Projects requiring consistent view definitions across dbt and Looker

## Features

- üöÄ Fast generation of LookML views from dbt models
- üîÑ Automatic type mapping from BigQuery to Looker
- üè∑Ô∏è Support for dbt tags and exposures
- üîó Automatic join detection and generation
- üìù Custom measure definition support
- üåê Locale file generation support

## Installation

### Via pip
```bash
pip install dbt2lookml
```

### Via poetry
```bash
git clone https://github.com/magnus-ffcg/dbt2lookml.git
cd dbt2lookml
poetry install
```

## Quick Start

1. **Generate dbt docs** (required for getting a manifest and catalog file to generate views from):
   ```bash
   dbt docs generate
   ```

2. **Generate Looker views**:
   ```bash
   dbt2lookml --target-dir target --output-dir output
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Filter by Tags
```bash
# Generate views for models tagged 'prod'
dbt2lookml --target-dir target --output-dir output --tag prod
```

### Filter by Model Name
```bash
# Generate view for model named 'test'
dbt2lookml --target-dir target --output-dir output --select test
```

### Work with Exposures
```bash
# Generate views for exposed models only
dbt2lookml --target-dir target --output-dir output --exposures-only

# Generate views for exposed models with specific tag
dbt2lookml --target-dir target --output-dir output --exposures-only --exposures-tag looker
```

### Additional Options
```bash
# Skip explore generation
dbt2lookml --target-dir target --output-dir output --skip-explore

# Use table names instead of model names
dbt2lookml --target-dir target --output-dir output --use-table-name

# Generate locale file
dbt2lookml --target-dir target --output-dir output --generate-locale
```

## Integration Example

Here's how you might integrate dbt2lookml in a production workflow:

1. Run dbt through Google Cloud Workflows
2. Generate dbt docs and elementary
3. Trigger a Pub/Sub message on completion
4. Cloud Function runs dbt2lookml
5. Push generated views to lookml-base repository
6. Import views in main Looker project

## Configuration

### Defining Looker Metadata

Add Looker-specific configuration in your dbt `schema.yml`:

```yaml
models:
  - name: model-name
    columns:
      - name: url
        description: "Page URL"
        meta:
          looker:
            dimension:
              hidden: true
              label: "Page URL"
              group_label: "Page Info"
            measures:
              - type: count_distinct
                sql_distinct_key: ${url}
                label: "Unique Pages"
              - type: count
                value_format_name: decimal_1
                label: "Total Page Views"
    meta:
      looker:
        joins:
          - join: users
            sql_on: "${users.id} = ${model-name.user_id}"
            type: left_outer
            relationship: many_to_one
```
