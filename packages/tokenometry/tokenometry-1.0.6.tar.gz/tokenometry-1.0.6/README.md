# Tokenometry

A tool that measures and analyzes all the critical data points of a crypto token—such as its price, volume, volatility, and market sentiment—to help users make informed decisions.

NOTE: in the 1.0.2 I removed the external API to fectch the data for Sentiment. It slows down the process, the code is still in `main_milesstone` in case you want to take a look.

## Crypto Analysis Bot

This repository contains a sophisticated, multi-strategy crypto analysis bot written in Python. The bot is designed to scan the cryptocurrency market, apply a range of analytical models, and generate trading signals based on a confluence of technical, sentiment, and on-chain data. It is architected to be flexible, allowing the user to switch between long-term investment, swing trading, and high-frequency day trading strategies.

## Features

* **Multi-Asset Scanning**: Monitors a configurable list of cryptocurrencies from Coinbase.
* **Multi-Timeframe Analysis (MTA)**: Establishes a long-term trend on a higher timeframe to filter and confirm signals on a lower timeframe.
* **Multi-Factor Signal Confirmation**:
    * **Technical Analysis**: Utilizes a robust combination of indicators, including Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
    * **News Sentiment Analysis**: Integrates with NewsAPI to gauge the prevailing market narrative and filter signals that run contrary to strong market sentiment.
    * **On-Chain Analysis**: Connects to the Glassnode API to analyze fundamental investor behavior, such as accumulation or distribution patterns based on exchange net flows.
* **Automated & Continuous Operation**: Designed to run 24/7 on a server, with a configurable analysis frequency and comprehensive logging for performance tracking and debugging.
* **Dynamic Risk Management**: Automatically calculates a suggested stop-loss and position size for every BUY signal based on market volatility (using the Average True Range - ATR) and a predefined risk percentage.
* **Secure Configuration**: All API keys and sensitive information are managed securely using an `.env` file.

## Strategies

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install tokenometry
```

### Option 2: Install from Source

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/nguyenph88/Tokenometry.git](https://github.com/nguyenph88/Tokenometry.git)
    cd Tokenometry
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the package in development mode:**
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

4.  **Set up your API keys (optional):**
    * Copy `env.example` to `.env`
    * Add your API keys to the `.env` file. The bot will gracefully handle missing keys by skipping the corresponding analysis.
    ```bash
    cp env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your actual API keys
    ```

## Usage

The bot can be configured to run in three different trading modes, each optimized for different trading styles and timeframes. The configuration is handled through the `example_usage.py` script, which demonstrates how to use the `Tokenometry` library.

### Quick Start

1. **Run the example script:**
   ```bash
   python example_usage.py
   ```

2. **Choose your strategy** by uncommenting one of the three configurations in the script:
   ```python
   # CHOOSE YOUR STRATEGY HERE
   chosen_config = DAY_TRADER_CONFIG      # For day trading
   # chosen_config = SWING_TRADER_CONFIG  # For swing trading
   # chosen_config = LONG_TERM_CONFIG     # For long-term investing
   ```

### Strategy Configurations

#### 1. Day Trader Strategy (High-Frequency)
**Best for:** Active day traders who want to capture intraday momentum shifts
**Analysis Frequency:** Every 5 minutes
**Timeframes:** 5-minute signals, 1-hour trend confirmation

```python
DAY_TRADER_CONFIG = {
    "STRATEGY_NAME": "Day Trader",
    "PRODUCT_IDS": ["BTC-USD", "ETH-USD", "SOL-USD", "AVAX-USD"],
    "GRANULARITY_SIGNAL": "FIVE_MINUTE",    # 5-minute chart for signals
    "GRANULARITY_TREND": "ONE_HOUR",        # 1-hour chart for trend
    "SHORT_PERIOD": 9,                      # Fast EMA
    "LONG_PERIOD": 21,                      # Slow EMA
    "RISK_PER_TRADE_PERCENTAGE": 0.5,      # Conservative 0.5% risk
    "ATR_STOP_LOSS_MULTIPLIER": 2.0,       # Tight stop-loss
}
```

**When to use:** During active trading hours when you want to catch quick momentum shifts and scalp small profits.

#### 2. Aggressive Swing Trader Strategy
**Best for:** Swing traders who hold positions for days to weeks
**Analysis Frequency:** Every 4 hours
**Timeframes:** 4-hour signals, daily trend confirmation

```python
SWING_TRADER_CONFIG = {
    "STRATEGY_NAME": "Aggressive Swing Trader",
    "PRODUCT_IDS": ["BTC-USD", "ETH-USD", "LINK-USD"],
    "GRANULARITY_SIGNAL": "FOUR_HOUR",     # 4-hour chart for signals
    "GRANULARITY_TREND": "ONE_DAY",        # Daily chart for trend

    "LONG_PERIOD": 50,                     # Long-term EMA
    "RISK_PER_TRADE_PERCENTAGE": 1.0,     # Standard 1% risk
    "ATR_STOP_LOSS_MULTIPLIER": 2.5,      # Moderate stop-loss
}
```

**When to use:** For capturing multi-day market swings and trend reversals, ideal for part-time traders.

#### 3. Long-Term Investor Strategy
**Best for:** Position traders and long-term investors
**Analysis Frequency:** Every 24 hours
**Timeframes:** Daily signals, weekly trend confirmation

```python

    "RISK_PER_TRADE_PERCENTAGE": 1.0,     # Standard 1% risk
    "ATR_STOP_LOSS_MULTIPLIER": 2.5,      # Moderate stop-loss
}
```

**When to use:** For identifying major market trends and making long-term investment decisions.

### Customizing Your Strategy

You can modify any configuration by editing the parameters:

```python
# Example: Custom day trading configuration
CUSTOM_DAY_TRADE = {
    "STRATEGY_NAME": "Custom Day Trader",
    "PRODUCT_IDS": ["BTC-USD", "ETH-USD"],  # Monitor fewer assets
    "GRANULARITY_SIGNAL": "FIVE_MINUTE",
    "GRANULARITY_TREND": "ONE_HOUR",
    "SHORT_PERIOD": 5,                      # Faster signals
    "LONG_PERIOD": 13,                      # Shorter trend
    "RSI_PERIOD": 10,                       # More sensitive RSI
    "RISK_PER_TRADE_PERCENTAGE": 0.25,     # Very conservative
    "ATR_STOP_LOSS_MULTIPLIER": 1.5,       # Tighter stops
}
```

### Understanding the Signals

The bot generates three types of signals:

- **BUY**: Golden cross (fast EMA > slow EMA) + bullish trend + RSI not overbought + MACD bullish
- **SELL**: Death cross (fast EMA < slow EMA) + bearish trend + RSI not oversold + MACD bearish  
- **HOLD**: No crossover or trend misalignment

### Risk Management Features

- **Automatic Stop-Loss**: Calculated using ATR (Average True Range) for volatility-adjusted stops
- **Position Sizing**: Automatically calculates position size based on your risk percentage
- **Portfolio Protection**: Each trade risks only the specified percentage of your portfolio

### Logging and Monitoring

The bot provides comprehensive logging:
- **Console Output**: Real-time signal information
- **File Logging**: Complete audit trail in `trading_app.log`
- **Signal Details**: Timestamp, asset, signal type, trend, price, and trade plan

### Running in Production

For 24/7 operation on a server:

1. **Use a process manager** like `systemd`, `supervisord`, or `PM2`
2. **Set up monitoring** to restart the bot if it crashes
3. **Configure log rotation** to manage log file sizes
4. **Set up alerts** for critical errors or signal generation
