"""
Example: Stream with Session Instructions

This example demonstrates how to provide session-specific instructions that will be
appended to the assistant's system prompt for the duration of the session.

Session instructions allow you to customize the assistant's behavior on a per-session
basis without modifying the assistant's configuration in Airtable.

Use cases:
- Providing user-specific context or preferences
- Setting temporary behavioral modifications
- Including session-specific information like current date/time, location, etc.
- Testing different prompts without changing the assistant configuration
