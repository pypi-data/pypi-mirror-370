# üêù PaperBee

<img src="images/paperbee_logo.png" width="200" height="auto" alt="logo"/>

PaperBee is a Python application designed to **automatically search for new scientific papers and post them** to your favorite channels.
Currently supported platforms:

- üü£ Slack
- üîµ Telegram
- üü¢ Zulip
- üü† Mattermost

---

## üöÄ How Does It Work?

![paperbee_pipeline](images/paperbee_pipeline.svg)

PaperBee queries scientific papers using user-specified keywords from PubMed and preprint services, relying on the [findpapers](https://github.com/jonatasgrosman/findpapers/) library.
Papers are then filtered either **manually via a command-line interface** or **automatically via an LLM**.
The filtered papers are posted to a Google Sheet and, if desired, to Slack, Telegram, Zulip or Mattermost channels.
PaperBee is easy to setup and configure with a simple `yml` file.

## üìù Setup Guide

### 1. Google Sheets Integration

1. **Create a Google Service Account:**
   [Official guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create)
   Needed to write found papers to a Google Spreadsheet.
2. **Create a JSON Key:**
   [Official guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete)
   Download and store the JSON file securely.
3. **Enable Google Sheets API:**
   In [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), enable the Google Sheets API for your service account.
4. **Create a Google Spreadsheet:**
   You can copy this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13QqH13psraWsTG5GJ7jrqA8PkUvP_HlzO90BMxYwzYw/).
   The sheet must have columns: `DOI`, `Date`, `PostedDate`, `IsPreprint`, `Title`, `Keywords`, `Preprint`, `URL`.
   The sheet name must be `Papers`.
5. **Share the Spreadsheet:**
   Add the service account email as an _Editor_.

### 2. üîë Get NCBI API Key

PaperBee uses the NCBI API to fetch papers and DOIs from PubMed.
[Get your free API key here.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v2/api/api-keys)

---

### 3. üì¢ Setup Posting Channels

> **You must set up at least one of the four platforms below.**

#### üü£ Slack (optional)

1. [Create a Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) (choose "From an app manifest").
2. Choose your workspace.
3. Copy the contents of `manifest.json` into the manifest box.
4. Review and create the app.
5. In **Install App** , install to Workspace and allow permissions. It is possible that you need to add a Bot Token Scope before installing, if that is the case, go to **OAuth & Permissions** -> **Scopes** and add a Bot Token Scope (any Bot Token Scope is good).
6. In **OAuth & Permissions**, copy the Bot User OAuth Token and paste it in the `bot_token` in the `config.yml` file.
7. In **Basic Information** -> **App-Level Tokens**, create an app-level token with `connections:write` scope.
8. Set `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` in the `config.yml` file to your desired channel's ID.

Update the **SLACK** variables in the `config.yml` file.

#### üîµ Telegram (optional)

1. Create a Telegram bot [Follow the instructions here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/#how-do-i-create-a-bot).
2. Create a channel or group, add the bot as admin.
3. Use [@myidbot](https://t.me/myidbot) to get the channel ID.

Update the **TELEGRAM** variables in the `config.yml` file.

#### üü¢ Zulip (optional)

1. [Create a Zulip bot](https://zulip.com/help/add-a-bot-or-integration) and download the `zuliprc` file.
2. Create a stream and subscribe the bot.

Update the **ZULIP** variables in the `config.yml` file.

#### üü† Mattermost (optional)

1. You have to enable personal access tokens in Mattermost. If you are not the admin of the Mattermost server, you will need to ask the admin to enable personal access tokens. Follow [these instructions](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/personal-access-token/), step 1. 
2. The admin of the Mattermost server needs to give permission to your user account to create a personal access token. If you are not the admin of the Mattermost server, ask the admin of the Mattermost server to grant you permission to create a personal access token. Follow the previously linked instructions, steps 2-4.
3. Create the personal access token with your user account. Also follow the previously linked instructions, steps 5-8. When you create the personal access token, copy the ‚ÄúAccess Token‚Äù (highlighted in bold), and paste it in the `token` in the **MATTERMOST** variables of the `config.yml` file.

Update the **MATTERMOST** variables in the `config.yml` file. The `url`, `team` and `channel` variables can be found out from the URL of the channel where you want to post the papers. For example, if the URL of the channel is https://mattermost.example.com/research-group/channels/test-paperbee, `url` is ‚Äúmattermost.example.com‚Äù, `team` is ‚Äúresearch-group‚Äù and `channel` is ‚Äútest-paperbee‚Äù.

---

### 4. ü§ñ Setup LLM for Automated Filtering (optional, but recommended)

> If you want to use LLM filtering, remember to add a `filtering_prompt.txt` file.
> See [Setup Query and LLM Filtering Prompt](#setup-query-and-llm-filtering-prompt).

#### OpenAI API

The OpenAI API is not free, but it is really cheap, usually 5$ is more than enough for a year of everyday LLM filtering.

- [Sign up for OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
- [Get your API key](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)
- Add credits to your account.

#### Ollama (Open Source LLMs)

- [Download Ollama](https://ollama.com/download/)
- Pull your preferred model (e.g., `ollama pull llama3.2`).

Update the **LLM** variables in the `config.yml` file. (LLM_PROVIDER, LANGUAGE_MODEL, OPENAI_API_KEY)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

PaperBee uses a YAML configuration file to specify all arguments.
Copy and customize the template below as `config.yml`:

### Example `config.yml`

```yaml
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID: "your-google-spreadsheet-id"
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON: "/path/to/your/google-credentials.json"
NCBI_API_KEY: "your-ncbi-api-key"

# path to the local root directory where query prompts and files are stored
LOCAL_ROOT_DIR: "/path/to/local/root/dir"

# Queries. You can set either only "query" to use in all databases or query_biorxiv and query_pubmed_arxiv.
# Note that biorxiv only accept OR boolean operator while pubmed and arxiv also accept AND and AND NOT, this is why tje two queries are separated.
# More info: https://github.com/jonatasgrosman/findpapers?tab=readme-ov-file#search-query-construction
query: "[AI for cell trajectories] OR [machine learning for cell trajectories] OR [deep learning for cell trajectories] OR [AI for cell dynamics] OR [machine learning for cell dynamics] OR [deep learning for cell dynamics]"
query_biorxiv: "[AI for cell trajectories] OR [machine learning for cell trajectories] OR [deep learning for cell trajectories] OR [AI for cell dynamics] OR [machine learning for cell dynamics] OR [deep learning for cell dynamics]"
query_pubmed_arxiv: "([single-cell transcriptomics]) AND ([Cell Dynamics]) AND ([AI] OR [machine learning] OR [deep learning]) AND NOT ([proteomics])"

# LLM Filtering (optional)
LLM_FILTERING: true
LLM_PROVIDER: "openai"
LANGUAGE_MODEL: "gpt-4o-mini"
OPENAI_API_KEY: "your-openai-api-key"
# Describe what are your interests and what kind of papers are relevant to your lab.
# Change lab focus and interests to your own. Feel free to add more details and examples, but leave the last sentence as is.
FILTERING_PROMPT: "You are a lab manager at a research lab focusing on machine learning methods development for single-cell RNA sequencing. Lab members are interested in developing methods to model cell dynamics. You are reviewing a list of research papers to determine if they are relevant to your lab. Please answer 'yes' or 'no' to the following question: Is the following research paper relevant?"

# Slack configuration
SLACK:
  is_posting_on: true
  bot_token: "your-slack-bot-token"
  channel_id: "your-slack-channel-id"
  app_token: "your-slack-app-token"

# Telegram configuration
TELEGRAM:
  is_posting_on: true
  bot_token: "your-telegram-bot-token"
  channel_id: "your-telegram-channel-id"

# Zulip configuration
ZULIP:
  is_posting_on: false
  prc: "path-to-your-zulip-prc"
  stream: "your-zulip-stream"
  topic: "your-zulip-topic"

# Mattermost configuration
MATTERMOST:
  is_posting_on: true             
  url: "your-mattermost-url"        # e.g. mattermost.example.com (do NOT include https://)
  token: "your-mattermost-token"
  team: "your-mattermost-team-name" # The team name (not display name)
  channel: "your-channel-name" # The channel name (not display name)

### üìÑ Example Query and Prompt

#### `query`

If specifying a list of keyword is enough, you can simply fit one query for all databases. Example:

```text
[AI for cell trajectories] OR [machine learning for cell trajectories] OR [deep learning for cell trajectories] OR [AI for cell dynamics] OR [machine learning for cell dynamics] OR [deep learning for cell dynamics]
```

Both Arxiv and Pubmed allow for more refined queries.
If you want to fine-tune the queries for pubmed and arxiv which allow for both AND and AND NOT boolean operators, then you will need to split the queries in two (read below).

#### `query_biorxiv`

This database has more requirements, so if your query is complex, you have to set a separate simple query for biorxiv, and a complex query for everything else. See [findpapers documentation](https://github.com/jonatasgrosman/findpapers?tab=readme-ov-file#search-query-construction) for more details. TLDR:

- Only **1-level grouping** is supported: no round brackets inside round brackets
- **Only OR connectors between parenthesis** are allowed, no `() AND ()`!
- **AND NOT is not allowed**
- All connectors must be either OR or AND. **No mixing**!

Here's an example of a valid query:

```text
[AI for cell trajectories] OR [machine learning for cell trajectories] OR [deep learning for cell trajectories] OR [AI for cell dynamics] OR [machine learning for cell dynamics] OR [deep learning for cell dynamics]
```

#### `query_pubmed_arxiv.txt`

Pubmed and Arxiv don't have such requirements, so query can be more complex:

```text
([single-cell transcriptomics]) AND ([Cell Dynamics]) AND ([AI] OR [machine learning] OR [deep learning]) AND NOT ([proteomics])
```

#### `filtering_prompt`

Simply describe your lab interests, which type of papers you want to see and which you don't. The more details, the better! But always leave the last sentence with the question as is. Here is an example:

```text
You are a lab manager at a research lab focusing on machine learning methods development for single-cell RNA sequencing. Lab members are interested in developing methods to model cell dynamics. You are reviewing a list of research papers to determine if they are relevant to your lab. Please answer 'yes' or 'no' to the following question: Is the following research paper relevant?
```
