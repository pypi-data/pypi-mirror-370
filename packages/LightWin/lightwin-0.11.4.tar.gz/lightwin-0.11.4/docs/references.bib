	abstract = {RF cavities in linear accelerators are subject to failure, preventing the beam from reaching it’s nominal energy. This is particularly problematic for Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS), where the thermal fluctuations of the spallation target must be avoided and every fault shall be rapidly compensated for. In this study we present LightWin. This tool under development aims to create a database of the possible cavity failures and their associated compensation settings for a given accelerator. We apply it on the MYRRHA ADS, with a scenario including various faults distributed along the accelerator, and compare the settings found by LightWin to those found by the code TraceWin. We show that both tools find different compensation settings. We also outline the limitations of LightWin and explain the upcoming improvements.},
