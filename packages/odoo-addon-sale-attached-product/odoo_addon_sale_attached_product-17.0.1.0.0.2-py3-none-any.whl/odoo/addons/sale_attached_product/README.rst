This module allows to define a set of products which will be added
automatically to the sales order whenever that product is present on it.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

To configure attached products:

1. Go to *Sales > Products > Products* and choose on you want to attach
   products to.
2. Go to the *Sales* tab and then to the *Attached products* section.
3. Add as many products as you want to.

If you want to autoupdate the products when they are added, set this
config parameter:

   - sale_attached_product.auto_update_attached_lines

Otherwise, the lines will be added, but they can be modified, deleted,
etc.

Usage
=====

Now that you have your product configured:

1. Place a new sale order and then add that product in a new line.
2. Once you save your order, the attached products will be added in new
   lines to the order with as many quantities as the main one.

If the global sale_attached_product.auto_update_attached_lines setting
is on:

1. Update the main product quantity and the attached product quantities
   will be updated in the same amount as well.
2. If we delete the main line, the attached ones will go away in any
   case.
