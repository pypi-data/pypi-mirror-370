## ConditionNotFound
### Reason
The operation or function requires a specific condition to run, but you did not provide that condition.

### Solution
When invoking the function or performing the operation, make sure to supply the required condition parameter.

### Notes
In general, this error should not occur; it is only raised for operations that explicitly require a condition to be passed.
