Spatially variant deconvolution
===============================

Introduction
------------

Deconvolutions when the PSF is not constant across the field of view can be carried out using the ``torchmfbd.DeconvolutionSV`` class
without any mosaicking. However, we note that mosaicking can still be used to reduce the memory footprint of the deconvolution.

This approach uses an expansion of the PSF in a suitable basis. We recommend to use the basis obtained using 
NMF, non-negative matrix factorization (``nmf``), although |torchmfbd| also offers the use of a basis computed
using PCA, principal component analysis, which does not impose non-negativity on the PSF (``pca``).

Computing the basis
-------------------

The basis is obtained numerically by computing many PSFs for Kolmogorov turbulence and then calculating a
suitable basis from the training set. |torchmfbd| offers the possibility to compute the basis automatically
and saved in a file. To this end, just do:

::

    basis = torchmfbd.Basis(n_pixel=128,
                 wavelength=8542.0,
                 diameter=100.0,
                 pix_size=0.059,
                 central_obs=0.0,
                 n_modes=150,
                 r0_min=15.0,
                 r0_max=50.0)
    
    basis.compute(type='nmf', n=1000, n_iter=400, verbose=0)

The ``torchmfbd.Basis`` class has the following parameters:

* ``n_pixel``: number of pixels in the image of the PSF. Try to keep this as small as possible while allowing all PSFs to fit inside the image (tip-tilt will be removed so you only need to be sure that the speckle of the centered PSF fit in the image).
* ``wavelength``: wavelength of the observation in Angstroms.
* ``diameter``: diameter of the telescope in cm
* ``pix_size``: pixel size in arcseconds
* ``central_obs``: central obscuration of the telescope in cm
* ``n_modes``: number of modes in the output basis
* ``r0_min``: minimum Fried parameter in cm used to compute the PSFs of Kolmogorov turbulence.
* ``r0_max``: maximum Fried parameter in cm used to compute the PSFs of Kolmogorov turbulence.

A typical NMF basis set looks like this:

.. image:: ../basis_8542_nmf.png
    :width: 600px
    :align: center


Example
-------

Once the basis is computed, you can carry out the deconvolution. At the moment, all objects have to 
share the wavelength and no diversity is alloed, but we are working on extending |torchmfbd| to allow for them.
The following example shows how to deconvolve a field of view with two objects without a diversity channel. The field of view
is deconvolved in one single patch. First we define a 
configuration file that controls the general behavior of the deconvolution. This configuration file can also
be defined in the code as a dictionary:

::

    telescope:
        diameter: 100.0
        central_obscuration : 0.0

    images:
        n_pixel : 128
        wavelength : 8542.0
        pix_size : 0.059
        apodization_border : 6

    object1:
        wavelength : 8542.0
        image_filter: tophat
        cutoff : [0.75, 0.80]

    object2:
        wavelength : 8542.0
        image_filter: tophat
        cutoff : [0.75, 0.80]
        
    optimization:
        gpu : 0
        transform : softplus
        softplus_scale : 1000.0        
        lr_obj : 0.02
        lr_tt : 0.003
        lr_modes : 0.08

    regularization:
        smooth1:
            variable: tiptilt
            lambda: 0.01
        smooth2:
            variable: modes
            lambda: 0.01
        iuwt1:
            variable : object
            lambda : 0.0
            nbands : 5

    psf:
        model : nmf        
        nmax_modes : 150
        filename: '../basis/nmf_8542_n_150_r0_5_30.npz'
        ngrid_modes: 2

    initialization:
        object : contrast
        modes_std : 0.0

    annealing:
        type: none
        start_pct : 0.0
        end_pct : 0.85

The deconvolution can be carried out by the following code:

::

    decSI = torchmfbd.DeconvolutionSV('spot_8542_nmf.yaml')

    # Patchify and add the frames
    for i in range(2):                
        decSI.add_frames(frames[:, i, :, :, :], id_object=i, id_diversity=0, diversity=0.0)


    decSI.deconvolve(simultaneous_sequences=1,
                     n_iterations=10,
                     batch_size=12)
        
    obj = [None] * 2
    for i in range(2):
        obj[i] = decSI.obj[i].cpu().numpy()

    fig, ax = pl.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2, figsize=(10, 10))
    for i in range(2):
        ax[0, i].imshow(frames[0, i, 0, :, :])
        ax[1, i].imshow(obj[i][0, :, :])
        
First, we instantiate the ``torchmfbd.DeconvolutionSV`` class with the configuration file. We then add the frames 
object by object, indicating the index of the object ``id_object`` and the index of the
diversity channel ``id_diversity``. Note that, |torchmfbd| does not yet allow for adding diversity or objects at
different wavelengths properly. In this case, we have two objects and no diversity channel, so we set ``id_diversity=0`` and
``diversity=0.0``.

The deconvolution is carried out by calling the ``deconvolve`` method. The method takes several arguments:

* ``simultaneous_sequences``: The number of patches to deconvolve simultaneously. If you have plenty of VRAM, you can increase this number to speed up the deconvolution.
* ``n_iterations``: The number of iterations to carry out.
* ``batch_size``: The batch size to use when dealing with the bursts.

Output
------

Once the deconvolution is finished, several attributes are available in the deconvolution object:

* ``obj``: The deconvolved objects.
* ``tiptilt_lr``: The spatially variant tiptilt coefficients 
* ``tiptilt_hr``: The spatially variant tiptilt coefficients interpolated to the full field of view
* ``modes_lr``: The spatially variant modal coefficients 
* ``modes_hr``: The spatially variant modal coefficients interpolated to the full field of view
