description: "Promote an existing deployment to current production"
---
Use Vercel CLI to promote an existing deployment to production.

Tasks:
1. List recent deployments to see available deployment URLs/IDs
2. Identify a suitable non-production deployment to promote
3. Use the `vercel promote` command to promote that deployment to current production
4. Verify the promotion was successful by checking the current production deployment

Success criteria:
- Must successfully execute the promote command
- Should confirm the deployment is now serving as production
- Report the URL and status of the promoted deployment
- Handle any authentication or permission issues gracefully

Note: This tests the ability to manage production releases through CLI promotion.
