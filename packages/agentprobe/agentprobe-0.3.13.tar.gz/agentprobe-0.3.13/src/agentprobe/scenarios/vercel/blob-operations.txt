Tasks:
1. Explore blob functionality using `vercel blob --help`
2. List existing blob stores if any exist
3. Try to create a test blob store or use existing one
4. Upload a small test file to the blob store
5. List files in the blob store
6. Download or access the uploaded file
7. Clean up test data if created

Success criteria:
- Must successfully explore blob management capabilities
- Should understand blob store creation and file operations
- Demonstrate file upload/download functionality
- Report blob store features and limitations
- Handle authentication and permission requirements

Note: This tests Vercel's blob storage features for file management, which may require specific permissions or billing setup.
