Use Vercel CLI to manage domain aliases for your deployments.

Tasks:
1. List current aliases using `vercel alias ls`
2. Get a deployment URL from recent deployments
3. Try to create a new alias using `vercel alias` command
4. List aliases again to verify the creation
5. If successful, try to remove the alias you just created
6. Explore other alias management options

Success criteria:
- Must successfully list existing aliases
- Should attempt to create and manage domain aliases
- Handle authentication and permission requirements
- Report available alias management capabilities
- Document any domain/DNS requirements or limitations

Note: This tests advanced domain management features that may require specific permissions or domain ownership.
