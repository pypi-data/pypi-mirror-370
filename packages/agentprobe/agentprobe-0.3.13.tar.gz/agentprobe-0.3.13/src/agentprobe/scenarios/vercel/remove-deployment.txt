Use Vercel CLI to remove deployments from your project.

Tasks:
1. List recent deployments to see available deployment IDs
2. Choose a deployment that can be safely removed (not production)
3. Use `vercel rm` or `vercel remove` command to delete the deployment
4. Verify the deployment was removed by listing deployments again
5. Understand the removal process and any confirmations required

Success criteria:
- Must successfully list existing deployments
- Should identify deployments that can be safely removed
- Execute deployment removal command successfully
- Verify the deployment is no longer listed
- Handle any confirmation prompts or safety checks

Note: This tests deployment cleanup capabilities for managing project resources and removing unused deployments.
