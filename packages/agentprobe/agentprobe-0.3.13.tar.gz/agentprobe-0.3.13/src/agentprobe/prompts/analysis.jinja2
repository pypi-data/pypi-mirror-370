Description: Analyzes AI agent CLI interactions to identify friction points and AX improvements
#}

You are analyzing how well an AI agent (Claude) was able to use a CLI tool to complete a task. Your goal is to identify friction points and provide actionable recommendations to improve the CLI's Agent Experience (AX).

**Original Task/Scenario:**
{{ scenario_text }}

**CLI Tool:** {{ tool_name }}

**Agent's Claimed Result:** {{ "SUCCESS" if claimed_success else "FAILURE" if claimed_success is not none else "UNKNOWN" }}

**Full Execution Trace:**
{{ trace_text }}

Please analyze this trace from an AX perspective and provide:

1. **Actual Success**: Did the agent actually complete the task successfully? (true/false)
2. **Claimed Success**: What did the agent claim as the result? (true/false)
3. **Discrepancy**: Is there a difference between claimed and actual success?
4. **Turn Count**: How many assistant messages (turns) did it take?
5. **CLI Friction Points**: What specific CLI behaviors caused confusion or extra turns?
   - Focus on: unclear error messages, missing feedback, ambiguous outputs, permission issues
6. **Help Usage**: Did the agent use --help or documentation? Was it helpful?
7. **AX Improvements**: Specific, actionable changes the CLI could make to reduce friction
   - Be concrete: "Add --status flag", not "improve feedback"
   - Focus on what would reduce turn count and confusion

Think about:
- Where did the agent get stuck or retry operations?
- What CLI outputs were ambiguous or misleading?
- What missing features forced workarounds?
- How could error messages be more actionable?
