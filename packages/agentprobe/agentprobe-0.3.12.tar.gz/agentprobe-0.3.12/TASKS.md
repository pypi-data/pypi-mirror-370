# AgentProbe Development Tasks

## Task Management Style Guide

### Priority Levels
- üî¥ **P0 (Critical)**: Must be done immediately, blocks other work
- üü† **P1 (High)**: Important features, should be next in queue
- üü° **P2 (Medium)**: Nice to have, implement when P0/P1 done
- üü¢ **P3 (Low)**: Future enhancements, not urgent

### Task Format
```
- [ ] [P#] Task description (Assignee: @name) [Status: Not Started/In Progress/Done]
  - [ ] Subtask 1
  - [ ] Subtask 2
```

### Status Tracking
- **Not Started**: Task hasn't begun
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Blocked**: Waiting on dependencies
- **Review**: Implementation complete, needs review
- **Done**: Fully complete and tested

### Completion Tracking
- Mark tasks with `[x]` when complete
- Add completion date: `[Done: 2025-01-20]`
- Strike through entire line when archived: `~~- [x] [P1] Completed task~~`

  - [x] Categorize errors by type (auth, missing deps, syntax, etc) (Claude-based categorization)
  - [x] Map errors to recommendations (Claude provides specific recommendations)
  - [ ] Add per-tool error patterns

  - [ ] Simple Flask/FastAPI server
  - [ ] Real-time result updates
  - [ ] Interactive charts and filters
  - [ ] Export capabilities from UI

## Additional Features

### üü¢ P3: Scenario Management

  - [ ] Scenario validation

### üü¢ P3: Plugin System
- [ ] [P3] Extensibility for custom analyzers [Status: Not Started]
  - [ ] Plugin architecture design
  - [ ] Custom analyzer API
  - [ ] Plugin discovery mechanism
  - [ ] Documentation for plugin development

## Current Implementation Status (Updated 2025-01-22)

### ‚úÖ What's Currently Working
- Core CLI framework (test, benchmark commands) - cli.py
- Claude Code SDK integration - runner.py
- Enhanced trace analysis with subprocess-based Claude analysis - analyzer.py
- Rich terminal reporting with success/failure detection - reporter.py
- Multi-run aggregation and statistics
- Comprehensive scenario library (vercel, gh, docker, git, wrangler)
- YAML frontmatter support for scenarios with metadata - scenario_parser.py
- Error pattern detection with Claude-based categorization - analyzer.py

### ‚ùå Major Missing Features
- **No persistence layer**: Results are not stored, only displayed
- **No historical tracking**: Cannot compare runs over time
- **No export capabilities**: Cannot save results to files
- **Report command is stub only**: cli.py:172 just shows placeholder message
- **No command pattern analysis**: Only basic error detection implemented
- **No CLI usability scoring**: No algorithmic assessment of tool friendliness

## Technical Decisions

### Database Choice: SQLite
- Embedded, no server needed
- Perfect for local development
- Easy to backup/share
- Can migrate to PostgreSQL later if needed

### Report Formats Priority
1. Markdown (easiest, git-friendly)
2. JSON (programmatic use)
3. HTML (visual reports)
4. CSV (data analysis)

### Analysis Focus
- Start with simple pattern matching
- Add ML-based analysis later
- Keep analysis pluggable
