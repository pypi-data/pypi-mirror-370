description: "Use binary search to find deployment that introduced a bug"

Use Vercel CLI's bisect feature to find the deployment that introduced a bug.

Tasks:
1. List recent deployments to understand the deployment history
2. Use `vercel bisect` command to start the debugging process
3. Follow the bisect process to identify problematic deployments
4. Test the bisect workflow and understand how it guides debugging
5. Report on the bisect process and its effectiveness

Success criteria:
- Must successfully initiate the bisect process
- Should understand and follow the bisect workflow
- Report how the bisect feature works for deployment debugging
- Document the steps and guidance provided by the CLI
- Handle cases where bisect may not be applicable

Note: This tests advanced debugging capabilities that help developers identify when bugs were introduced across deployment history. The bisect command may require specific conditions or deployment history to be effective.
