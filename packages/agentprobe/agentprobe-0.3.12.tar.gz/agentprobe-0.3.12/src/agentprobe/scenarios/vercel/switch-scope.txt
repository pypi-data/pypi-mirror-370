description: "Switch between different teams or scopes"
---
Use Vercel CLI to manage scope switching between teams or personal accounts.

Tasks:
1. Check current scope/team using `vercel whoami`
2. List available scopes/teams if possible
3. Use `vercel switch` command to see switching options
4. If multiple scopes are available, demonstrate switching between them
5. Verify the scope change was successful

Success criteria:
- Must identify current scope/team context
- Should explore scope switching capabilities
- Report available scopes and current active scope
- Handle cases where only one scope is available

Note: This tests team/organization management capabilities through the CLI.
