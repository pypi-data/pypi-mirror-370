Use Vercel CLI to check your current user identity and authentication status.

Tasks:
1. Run `vercel whoami` to check current user
2. Verify authentication status and account information
3. Report user details, team membership, and current scope
4. Check if additional authentication is needed

Success criteria:
- Must successfully retrieve user identity information
- Should show current authentication status
- Report username, email, and active scope/team
- Handle cases where authentication may be required

Note: This tests basic authentication and user identity verification through the CLI.
