Use Vercel CLI to manage domain names for your projects.

Tasks:
1. List current domains using `vercel domains ls`
2. Explore domain management options with `vercel domains --help`
3. Check domain status and configuration details
4. Understand how to add/remove domains from projects
5. Examine domain verification and setup requirements

Success criteria:
- Must successfully list existing domains
- Should explore domain management capabilities
- Report domain status, verification state, and configuration
- Document domain addition/removal processes
- Handle authentication and permission requirements

Note: This tests domain management features that may require domain ownership verification and specific account permissions.
