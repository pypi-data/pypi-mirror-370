description: "Manage DNS records for custom domains"
---
Use Vercel CLI to manage DNS records for your domains.

Tasks:
1. List current DNS records using `vercel dns ls`
2. Explore DNS management options with `vercel dns --help`
3. If you have custom domains, examine their DNS configuration
4. Try to understand how to add/modify DNS records
5. Check if there are any DNS verification requirements

Success criteria:
- Must successfully list existing DNS records
- Should explore DNS management capabilities
- Report current DNS configuration
- Document available DNS record types and operations
- Handle cases where no custom domains exist

Note: This tests DNS management features that require custom domain ownership and may have limited functionality without proper domain setup.
