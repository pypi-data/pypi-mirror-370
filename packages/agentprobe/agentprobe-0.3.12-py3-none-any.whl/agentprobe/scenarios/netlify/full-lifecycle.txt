You are starting with a local directory that is not yet a Netlify project. Your task is to perform the following sequence of actions using the Netlify CLI:
1. Create a new, empty site on Netlify. Name it 'agentprobe-test-site-[random-string]'.
2. From the command output, get the Site ID of the newly created site.
3. Link the current local directory to that new remote site.
4. Set a production environment variable named `TEST_API_KEY` with the value `123-ABC-789`.
5. Deploy the current directory to production.
6. Verify the deployment was successful by checking the site's status or logs.
7. As a final cleanup step, delete the site you created using its Site ID.
