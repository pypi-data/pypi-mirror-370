description: "Rebuild and redeploy a previous deployment"
---
Use Vercel CLI to redeploy an existing deployment.

Tasks:
1. List recent deployments to get available deployment URLs/IDs
2. Select a previous deployment to redeploy
3. Use the `vercel redeploy` command to rebuild and redeploy that deployment
4. Monitor the redeploy process and verify completion
5. Compare the new deployment URL with the original

Success criteria:
- Must successfully trigger a redeploy operation
- Should provide the new deployment URL
- Verify the redeploy process completed successfully
- Report any differences between original and redeployed versions

Note: This tests the ability to reproduce deployments, which is useful for debugging and rollback scenarios.
