description: "Manage SSL certificates for custom domains"
---
Use Vercel CLI to manage SSL certificates for your domains.

Tasks:
1. List current SSL certificates using `vercel certs ls`
2. Explore certificate management options with `vercel certs --help`
3. If you have custom domains, check their certificate status
4. Try to view certificate details for existing certificates
5. Understand the certificate lifecycle and renewal process

Success criteria:
- Must successfully list existing certificates
- Should explore certificate management capabilities
- Report certificate status and expiration information
- Document available certificate operations
- Handle cases where no custom domains/certificates exist

Note: This tests SSL certificate management features that may require custom domains and specific permissions. May be limited if no custom domains are configured.
