description: "Pull project settings from Vercel cloud to local directory"
---
Use Vercel CLI to pull project settings from the cloud to the local directory.

Tasks:
1. Check if the current directory is linked to a Vercel project
2. Use the `vercel pull` command to download project settings from the cloud
3. Verify what files and settings were downloaded (e.g., .vercel/, environment variables, project configuration)
4. Check if local configuration files were created or updated
5. Review the pulled settings to understand project configuration

Success criteria:
- Must successfully execute the pull command
- Should download project settings to local directory
- Verify what configuration files were created/updated
- Report the structure and content of pulled settings

Note: This tests synchronization between cloud project configuration and local development environment.
