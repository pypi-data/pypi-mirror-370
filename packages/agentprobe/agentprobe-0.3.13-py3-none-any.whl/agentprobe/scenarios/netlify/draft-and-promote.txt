Your goal is to first create a preview of a new deployment and then push it to production.
1. Deploy the current project to a draft URL using the custom alias 'staging-release-candidate'.
2. After the draft deployment is complete, your next task is to promote this exact build to production.
3. The final result should be the main site URL updated with the content from the draft deploy.

Note: The Netlify CLI may not have a direct 'promote' command. You need to figure out the correct command to achieve the goal of making the draft content live on the production URL.
