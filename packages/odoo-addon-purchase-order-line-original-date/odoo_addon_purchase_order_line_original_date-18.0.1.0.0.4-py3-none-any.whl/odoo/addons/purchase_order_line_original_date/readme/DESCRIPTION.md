This module adds the *Original Expected Arrival* to Purchase Order lines.
This is useful for past analysis and vendor performance reports.

In standard Odoo, once a PO is confirmed with expected arrivals on its
lines, this dates can still change to reflect changes in the planning
(e.g. you receive a notification from your supplier that goods will
arrive a couple of days later). In such situation you lost precious
information of the original expected arrivals that can be used to compute
the real delay in the receipt from your supplier.
