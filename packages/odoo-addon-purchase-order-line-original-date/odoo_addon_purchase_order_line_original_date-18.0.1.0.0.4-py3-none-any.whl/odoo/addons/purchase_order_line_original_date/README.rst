This module adds the *Original Expected Arrival* to Purchase Order
lines. This is useful for past analysis and vendor performance reports.

In standard Odoo, once a PO is confirmed with expected arrivals on its
lines, this dates can still change to reflect changes in the planning
(e.g. you receive a notification from your supplier that goods will
arrive a couple of days later). In such situation you lost precious
information of the original expected arrivals that can be used to
compute the real delay in the receipt from your supplier.

Usage
=====

1. Create a new PO and assign an expected arrival to its lines.
2. Confirm the PO.
3. Change the expected arrival of some lines.
4. Original expected arrival is kept unchanged.
