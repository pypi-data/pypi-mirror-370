This module enhances the features of the `website_snippet_country_dropdown`
module, and its implementation and functionality are very similar. It offers a
snippet with a dropdown for selecting a country as well as an input text field
that auto-populates with the corresponding phone code. This module is intended
to serve as a base for other modules to inherit and integrate into HTML forms.

**Table of contents**

Usage
=====

To extend this template, you should inherit the `country_dropdown` template and
add your custom code. This template includes three input text fields, which are
the following:

#. ``no_country_field``: Field without code country.
#. ``country_phone_code_field``: Field with only country code (read only)
#. ``complete_field``: Field with the previous two joined (hidden)

The name of the complete field is customizable when user insert the snippet
into a form element with the website editor.

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use this element, you can call the reusable Qweb template
`website_snippet_country_phone_code_dropdown.country_dropdown` in your views or
forms to add a sensible country-combined field, which could be a useful element
for the registration of international phone numbers.

**Default Country Selection**

The default country will be determined by the first match among:

#. Extracted from the `default_country` variable.
#. Extracted from the `default_value_prefix` variable, searching by phone code.
#. The current user's country.
#. The current website's company's country.
#. The first country in the list.

**Variables**

All variables you can use to modify its behavior:

#. ``complete_field``: To give the form information a name. Habitually it will
   match the field name.
#. ``default_value_prefix``: The phone prefix to be used in the complete_field.
#. ``default_value_number``: The phone number to be used in the complete_field.
#. ``countries``: A recordset of res.country containing all the available
   countries.
#. ``default_country``: A res.country record representing the default country.
#. ``no_country_placeholder``: A placeholder text for the phone number input
   field.
