This module enhances the features of the `website_snippet_country_dropdown`
module, and its implementation and functionality are very similar. It offers a
snippet with a dropdown for selecting a country as well as an input text field
that auto-populates with the corresponding phone code. This module is intended
to serve as a base for other modules to inherit and integrate into HTML forms.
