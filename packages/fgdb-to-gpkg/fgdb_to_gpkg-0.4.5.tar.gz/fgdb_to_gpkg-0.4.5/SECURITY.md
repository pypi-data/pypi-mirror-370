## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our Python package very seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in our package, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

### Guidelines for Reporting Vulnerabilities:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly. Give us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before sharing it with others.

2. **Provide Detailed Information**:
   - **Type of Vulnerability**: Describe the nature of the vulnerability.
   - **Steps to Reproduce**: Provide a step-by-step guide so that we can reproduce the issue on our end. This will help us resolve the problem more efficiently.
   - **Version Affected**: Mention the version(s) of the package where you noticed the vulnerability.
   - **Potential Impact**: If possible, let us know your thoughts on the potential impact of the vulnerability.

3. **Use a Descriptive Subject Line**: When sending an email or creating an issue, use a subject that describes the vulnerability, such as "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in [Function/Feature Name]" or "Buffer Overflow in [Function/Feature Name]."

4. **Avoid Data Destruction**: If the vulnerability involves any kind of data deletion or corruption, please refrain from executing it on live platforms.

### How to Report:

You can report vulnerabilities by:

- **GitHub Issue**: Create a new issue on our GitHub repository (if it's a private repository or if you think the disclosure can be made in this manner).

Upon receiving your report:

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- We'll work to confirm the vulnerability and keep you updated on our progress.
- Once the issue is resolved, we'll notify you and provide details of the resolution.

### Responsible Disclosure Policy:

We kindly ask that you:

- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it.
- Do not use the vulnerability to access, delete, alter, or otherwise harm data.
- Do not reveal the vulnerability to others until it has been resolved.

We are committed to addressing all security issues in a timely manner and appreciate your effort in responsibly disclosing them to us.
