`nature-sounds` uses sounds from the National Park Service's [A Symphony of Sounds](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/sound/index.htm).
Previews of the sounds are available from the [Yellowstone](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/photosmultimedia/sounds-soundscapes.htm) or [Rocky Mountain National Park](https://www.nps.gov/romo/learn/photosmultimedia/sounds-ambient-soundscapes.htm) soundscapes collections.
If you enjoy these sounds, consider [donating to the NPS](https://www.nps.gov/getinvolved/donate.htm).
