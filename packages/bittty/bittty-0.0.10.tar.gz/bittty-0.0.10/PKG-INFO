# bittty

A pure Python terminal emulator.

Almost usable; some scroll region problems, doesn't like textual in textual yet.

## Demo

Run the standalone demo:

```bash
python ./demo/terminal.py
```

Or use the textual demo to see it in a TUI:

```bash
uvx textual-tty
```

## Recent changes

* 🪟 tests run on Windows runner
* 📉 added parser benchmarking and tui graphs
* 🐌 use regex for parsing to speed things up a tad (~2x faster)
* 📚 document half a billion DEC private modes we don't support
* 🔙 DECLM - allow `\n` to act like `\r\n` so we don't have to rely on cooked
  input on the pty when using as a library.
* 🖼️ DEC Special Graphics
* 🐌 Faster colour/style parser
* ⛓️‍💥 Split out from `textual-tty` into separate package
