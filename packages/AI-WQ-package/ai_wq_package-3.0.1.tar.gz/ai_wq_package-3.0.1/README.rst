# AI_weather_quest
Python code to support and participate in ECMWF-hosted AI Weather Quest

To participate in the AI Weather Quest, you will need to install the AI-WQ-package Python package. This package requires Python version 3, and its source code is available on GitHub.

**Installation**

To install the package on a Linux system, use the following command:   
_python3 -m pip install AI-WQ-package_

If you need assistance installing Python 3 or pip, we recommend referring to the official documentation for guidance.

**Dependencies**

The AI-WQ-package has two dependencies:
  	numpy (version 1.23 or higher)
  	xarray (version 2024.09.0 or higher).

If these dependencies might conflict with your working environment, we recommend installing the package in a virtual environment to isolate its impact.

**Upgrading the package**

_python3 -m pip install --upgrade AI-WQ-package_
