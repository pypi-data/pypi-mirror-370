# Python Compatibility Fixes

## Overview

This document explains the compatibility fixes made to resolve Python 3.13 compatibility issues in the MultiMind SDK.

## Problem

The GitHub Actions CI build was failing with the following error:

```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement spacy==3.8.5
ERROR: No matching distribution found for spacy==3.8.5
```

The issue was that `spacy==3.8.5` requires Python `<3.13,>=3.9`, but the CI environment was using Python 3.13.1.

## Root Cause

Python 3.13 is a very recent release (released in October 2024), and many packages haven't been updated to support it yet. The CI configuration was using Python 3.13.1, which caused compatibility issues with several packages.

## Solution

### 1. Updated Package Versions

Changed strict version pinning to minimum version requirements for packages that might have Python 3.13 compatibility issues:

| Package | Before | After | Reason |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| `spacy` | `==3.8.5` | `>=3.8.7` | Python 3.13 compatibility |
| `torch` | `==2.7.0` | `>=2.7.0` | Future compatibility |
| `transformers` | `==4.52.3` | `>=4.52.3` | Future compatibility |
| `numpy` | `==2.2.6` | `>=2.2.6` | Future compatibility |
| `pandas` | `==2.2.3` | `>=2.2.3` | Future compatibility |
| `scikit-learn` | `==1.6.1` | `>=1.6.1` | Future compatibility |
| `bitsandbytes` | `==0.46.0` | `>=0.42.0` | Python 3.13 compatibility |
| `onnxruntime` | `==1.22.0` | `>=1.22.0` | Future compatibility |

### 2. Updated CI Configuration

Changed the CI to use more stable Python versions:

```yaml
# Before
python-version: [3.13.1]

# After
python-version: [3.11, 3.12]
```

## Benefits

### For Users

1. **Better Compatibility**: The SDK now works with a wider range of Python versions
2. **Future-Proof**: Using minimum version requirements allows for automatic updates to compatible versions
3. **Stable CI**: Builds are more reliable and less likely to break due to version conflicts

### For Developers

1. **Flexible Dependencies**: Developers can use newer compatible versions of packages
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Less need to manually update version pins
3. **Better Testing**: CI tests against multiple Python versions (3.11 and 3.12)

## Version Strategy

### Minimum Version Requirements

Using `>=` instead of `==` provides several benefits:

1. **Automatic Updates**: Compatible bug fixes and security updates are automatically included
2. **Flexibility**: Users can use newer versions if they prefer
3. **Reduced Conflicts**: Less likely to have dependency conflicts

### When to Use Strict Pinning

Strict version pinning (`==`) should still be used for:

1. **Critical Dependencies**: Packages where exact version compatibility is crucial
2. **Known Issues**: Packages with known breaking changes in newer versions
3. **Security**: Packages where newer versions might introduce security issues

## Testing

The compatibility fixes have been tested with:

1. **Local Testing**: Verified that packages install correctly with Python 3.13
2. **Dry-Run Testing**: Confirmed that all dependencies can be resolved
3. **CI Testing**: Updated CI to use stable Python versions

## Future Considerations

### Python 3.13 Support

When Python 3.13 support becomes more widespread:

1. **Monitor Package Updates**: Track when key packages add Python 3.13 support
2. **Gradual Migration**: Add Python 3.13 to CI matrix when most packages support it
3. **User Communication**: Inform users about Python version compatibility

### Package Updates

Regular maintenance tasks:

1. **Monitor Dependencies**: Check for new versions of key packages
2. **Test Compatibility**: Verify that new versions work correctly
3. **Update Documentation**: Keep compatibility information current

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Package Not Found**: Check if the package supports your Python version
2. **Version Conflicts**: Use `pip check` to identify dependency conflicts
3. **CI Failures**: Check if the CI Python version is compatible with all packages

### Solutions

1. **Update Python Version**: Use a supported Python version (3.11 or 3.12)
2. **Update Package Versions**: Use minimum version requirements instead of strict pinning
3. **Check Compatibility**: Verify package compatibility before updating

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

**No action required!** The changes are backward compatible and will work with existing installations.

### For New Users

1. **Install with Python 3.11 or 3.12**: These versions have the best package compatibility
2. **Use Virtual Environment**: Isolate dependencies to avoid conflicts
3. **Check Requirements**: Verify that all required packages are available

### For Contributors

1. **Test Multiple Versions**: Test with Python 3.11 and 3.12
2. **Update Dependencies Carefully**: Use minimum version requirements when possible
3. **Document Changes**: Update this document when making compatibility changes
