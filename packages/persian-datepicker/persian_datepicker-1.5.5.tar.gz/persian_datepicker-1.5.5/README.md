## Installation
Install the package via pip:

```

## Current Version

## Quick Start
Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started with the Persian DatePicker:

```python
import flet as ft
from persian_datepicker import PersianDatePicker

def main(page: ft.Page):
    datepicker = PersianDatePicker()
    
    def handle_result(result):
        if result:
            print(f"Selected: {result['formatted_persian']}")
    
    datepicker.set_result_callback(handle_result)
    
    def show_datepicker(e):
        datepicker.show(page)
    
    page.add(ft.ElevatedButton("Select Date", on_click=show_datepicker))

ft.app(target=main)
```
Run this code after installing the package to see a basic datepicker with a button to open it. The selected date will be printed in Persian format.
