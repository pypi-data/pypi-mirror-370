use_2d_matryoshka: true # Use 2D Matryoshka to train over transformer layers in addition to embedding dimensions.
n_layers_per_step:
  -1 # The number of layers to use per step. If -1, then all layers are used.
  # If > 0, then a random sample of n_layers_per_step layers are used per step.
last_layer_weight:
  1.0 # The weight to use for the loss of the final layer.
  # Increase this to focus more on the performance when using all layers.
prior_layers_weight:
  1.0 # The weight to use for the loss of the prior layers.
  # Increase this to focus more on the performance when using fewer layers.
kl_div_weight:
  1.0 # The weight to use for the KL-div loss that is used to make the prior layers match that of the last layer.
  # Increase this to focus more on the performance when using fewer layers.
kl_temperature:
  0.3 # The temperature to use for the KL-divergence loss.
  # If 0, then the KL-divergence loss is not used.
