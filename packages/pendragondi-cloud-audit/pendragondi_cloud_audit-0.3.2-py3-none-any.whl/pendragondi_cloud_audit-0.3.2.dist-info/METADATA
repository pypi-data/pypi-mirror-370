# PendragonDI Cloud Audit

> **Find stale, oversized, or duplicate files in cloud storage — without touching your data.**

PendragonDI Cloud Audit is a lightweight command-line tool that helps you uncover hidden cost drivers in your cloud storage buckets:
- Unused or stale files
- Duplicate objects
- Oversized resources
- Cold data that hasn’t been touched in months

It runs **entirely locally** using your own credentials. No file content is ever read. No objects are ever modified.

---

## 🔍 Why It Exists

Most teams store more than they realize—and rarely clean up:

- ☁️ Cloud object stores are treated like infinite file systems
- 💸 Many orgs pay for **millions of forgotten or duplicate files**
- 🧱 Native tools are clunky, slow, or deeply integrated with billing

PendragonDI Cloud Audit gives you **a fast, metadata-only snapshot** of wasteful storage across AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob—**before it shows up on your invoice**.

---

## ✅ Features

- 🔍 Identifies stale files based on last-modified timestamp
- 🪞 Detects potential duplicates using file size, name, and timestamp
- 🧾 Outputs clean, readable HTML or CSV reports
- 💡 Estimates storage cost impact
- 🧪 Supports limit-based sampling for fast iteration
- 🔐 Operates with your credentials — no external access required
- 🔒 Never reads, moves, or deletes content

## 🛠️ Installation

### Core CLI only (no provider):

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Run a scan:

```bash
pendragondi-cloud-audit scan aws my-bucket --days-stale 90 --output report.html
```

You can also limit the number of objects scanned:

```bash
pendragondi-cloud-audit scan gcs my-bucket --days-stale 60 --limit 10000 --output audit.csv
```

## 📄 Example Report

```html
Total Files: 3200 • Stale: 1800 • Duplicates: 400
```

Results can be opened in any browser or spreadsheet tool.
