# PendragonDI Cloud Audit

> **Find stale, oversized, or duplicate files in cloud storage — without touching your data.**

PendragonDI Cloud Audit is a lightweight command-line tool that helps you uncover hidden cost drivers in your cloud storage buckets:
- Unused or stale files
- Duplicate objects
- Oversized resources
- Cold data that hasn’t been touched in months

It runs **entirely locally** using your own credentials. No file content is ever read. No objects are ever modified.

## 🔍 Why It Exists

Most teams store more than they realize—and rarely clean up:

- ☁️ Cloud object stores are treated like infinite file systems
- 💸 Many orgs pay for **millions of forgotten or duplicate files**
- 🧱 Native tools are clunky, slow, or deeply integrated with billing

PendragonDI Cloud Audit gives you **a fast, metadata-only snapshot** of wasteful storage across AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob—**before it shows up on your invoice**.

## ✅ Features

- 🔍 Identifies stale files based on last-modified timestamp
- 🪞 Detects potential duplicates using file size, name, and timestamp
- 🧾 Outputs clean, readable HTML or CSV reports
- 💡 Estimates storage cost impact
- 🧪 Supports limit-based sampling for fast iteration
- 🔐 Operates with your credentials — no external access required
- 🔒 Never reads, moves, or deletes content
