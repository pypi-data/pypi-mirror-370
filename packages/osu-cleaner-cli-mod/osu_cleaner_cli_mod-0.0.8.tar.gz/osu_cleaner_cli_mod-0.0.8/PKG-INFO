# osu-cleaner-cli-mod

> Modified fork of [Layerex/osu-cleaner-cli](https://github.com/Layerex/osu-cleaner-cli)

Remove unwanted files from osu! Songs directory. A rewrite of [that](https://github.com/henntix/osu-cleaner) tool, which is not cross-platform and does not work as intended.

## What's changed in this fork
- Cleans more thoroughly: also removes matching unwanted files located in subfolders inside beatmaps.
- Safer by default: runs in **dry-run mode** unless `--force` is specified.

## Installation

```bash
pip install osu-cleaner-cli-mod
```

## Usage

```
usage: osu-cleaner-cli-mod [-h] [--delete-videos] [--delete-hitsounds]
                           [--delete-backgrounds] [--delete-skin-elements]
                           [--delete-storyboard-elements] [--delete-all]
                           [--force]
