## Grid set-up
When creating the grid, if you press <kbd>g</kbd> or select the `Add grid` option, the parameters to setup the grid will appear in the right panel of the viewer.

You can set-up the number of lines and columns. 
By default, the name of each cell of the grid is displayed in the center of the cell.
You can disable this by unselecting `display text` in the top left panel of the `FisherGrid` layer (which should be selected).
In that panel, you can also modify the width of the grid lines and its color.
