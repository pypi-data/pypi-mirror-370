# Security Policy

## Overview

LogSentinelAI is an AI-powered log analysis tool that processes sensitive log data and integrates with external LLM providers and Elasticsearch. We take security seriously and appreciate the community's help in identifying and responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 0.2.x   | :white_check_mark: | Current stable release |
| 0.1.x   | :warning:          | Legacy support (critical security fixes only) |
| < 0.1   | :x:                | No longer supported |

## Security Considerations

### Data Sensitivity
LogSentinelAI processes potentially sensitive log data that may contain:
- IP addresses and network information
- User agents and system identifiers
- Application error messages
- Authentication attempts and failures

### External Dependencies
The tool integrates with external services that require security considerations:
- **LLM Providers**: OpenAI API, Ollama, vLLM
- **Elasticsearch**: Log storage and indexing
- **SSH Connections**: Remote log access
- **GeoIP Services**: MaxMind GeoLite2 database

### Configuration Security
- API keys and credentials must be properly secured
- SSH keys should be used instead of passwords when possible
- Elasticsearch credentials should follow least-privilege principles

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### What to Report
Please report any security vulnerabilities you discover, including but not limited to:

- **Authentication bypass**: Unauthorized access to log data or system functions
- **Injection vulnerabilities**: SQL injection, command injection, or prompt injection
- **Data exposure**: Unintended disclosure of sensitive log data or credentials
- **Privilege escalation**: Unauthorized elevation of user permissions
- **Denial of Service**: Vulnerabilities that could crash or significantly slow the system
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Security issues in third-party libraries
- **Configuration flaws**: Insecure default configurations or settings

### How to Report

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Configuration Security
```bash
# Use environment variables for sensitive data
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Secure file permissions for configuration
chmod 600 config

# Use SSH keys instead of passwords
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/logsentinel_key
```

#### Network Security
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all external API connections
- Implement proper firewall rules for Elasticsearch
- Consider VPN or SSH tunneling for remote log access

#### Access Control
- Follow least-privilege principles for system access
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials
- Monitor access logs for unusual activity

### For Developers

#### Secure Development
- All user inputs must be properly validated and sanitized
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Regular dependency updates and security scanning

#### Code Review Guidelines
- Security-focused code reviews for authentication/authorization code
- Validation of all external data sources
- Review of credential handling and storage
- Assessment of logging practices to avoid sensitive data exposure

## Security Features
