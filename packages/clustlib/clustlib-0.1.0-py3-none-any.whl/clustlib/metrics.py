"""Metrics module.

This module contains some methods to calculate the infeasibility of a clustering.

The infeasibility is a measure of how much the clustering violates the constraints.
It is one of the most important metrics to evaluate the quality of a clustering,
since it is the only one that takes into account the constraints.
