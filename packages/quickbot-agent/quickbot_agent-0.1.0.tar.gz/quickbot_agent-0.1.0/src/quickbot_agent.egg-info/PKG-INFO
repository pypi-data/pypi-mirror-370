# quickbot-agent

GPT-based function calling and dialogue orchestration plugin for the QuickBot framework.

quickbot-tools is a plugin for the QuickBot framework that enables natural language understanding and structured function execution using OpenAI GPT models.
It provides a universal mechanism for:
	•	Interpreting user requests in plain language
	•	Resolving entities from business data
	•	Managing multi-step dialogues with function chaining
	•	Executing registered business methods via structured tool calls
	•	Returning AI-generated natural language summaries of results

Ideal for AI assistants that act as business logic mediators, schedulers, or interactive client-facing agents.
