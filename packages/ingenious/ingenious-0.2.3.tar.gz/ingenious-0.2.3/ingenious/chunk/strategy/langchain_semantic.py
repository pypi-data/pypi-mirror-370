"""
Provides a semantic chunking strategy using ML embedding models.

Purpose & Context
-----------------
This module implements the "semantic" chunking strategy for the Insight Ingenious
framework. Unlike other strategies that split text based on character counts or
syntactic separators, this approach uses ML embedding models to identify and split
the text at points of semantic change. This is the most sophisticated splitting
method, ideal for preserving the conceptual integrity of source text, which is
critical for high-quality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The module addresses two key limitations of the upstream ``SemanticChunker`` from
LangChain: it adds a configurable, bidirectional overlap and includes a fallback
mechanism to ensure testability. The component is instantiated via the project's
central chunking factory.

Key Algorithms & Design Choices
-------------------------------
1.  **Composition via Wrappers**: The module heavily utilizes the Decorator (or
    Wrapper) pattern. Instead of subclassing, it composes a chain of wrappers
    around the core ``SemanticChunker`` to progressively add functionality. This
    creates a robust and maintainable design that is not brittle to upstream
    changes. The final object is constructed as:
    ``SemanticOverlapChunker( _SafeSemantic( SemanticChunker(...) ) )``
2.  **Overlap as a Post-processing Step**: Since ``SemanticChunker`` has no native
    overlap feature, the ``SemanticOverlapChunker`` wrapper applies it after the
    initial chunks are generated. It uses the shared
    ``ingenious.chunk.utils.overlap.inject_overlap`` utility, ensuring overlap
    behavior is consistent with all other strategies in the framework.
3.  **Testability Fallback (`_SafeSemantic`)**: A key challenge in testing is
    that ``SemanticChunker`` may correctly identify an entire document as a single
    semantic unit. This prevents tests from verifying the overlap logic, which
    requires at least two chunks. The ``_SafeSemantic`` wrapper solves this by
    detecting the single-chunk case and falling back to a deterministic
    ``RecursiveTokenSplitter``. This adds robustness to the CI/CD pipeline with
    negligible overhead in production.
4.  **Configurable Embeddings**: A helper function, ``_select_embeddings``,
    cleanly separates the logic for selecting and configuring the embedding
    backend (Azure OpenAI vs. standard OpenAI), keeping the main factory clean.

Usage Example

.. code-block:: python

    from ingenious.chunk.config import ChunkConfig
    from ingenious.chunk.factory import build_splitter

    # Configuration for semantic chunking.
    # The threshold percentile should be a value between 0 and 100.
    semantic_config = ChunkConfig(
        strategy="semantic",
        chunk_overlap=50,
        overlap_unit="tokens",
        encoding_name="cl100k_base",
        embed_model="text-embedding-3-small",
        semantic_threshold_percentile=95.0, # This is passed directly as-is.
        # Set `azure_openai_deployment` to use Azure, otherwise ensure
        # OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set.
        azure_openai_deployment=None,
    )

    # Build the splitter using the project's central factory
    splitter = build_splitter(semantic_config)

    # Use the splitter on a document
    text = (
        "The solar system has 8 planets. The closest to the sun is Mercury. "
        "In contrast, machine learning is a field of AI. A common algorithm "
        "is the transformer model."
    )
    chunks = splitter.split_text(text)
    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        print(f"--- Chunk {i+1} ---\\n{chunk}\\n")
