Global Rights Dataset (2001-2023).

This dataset compiles global indicators related to LGBTIQ+ rights and
broader social and economic context. It draws from a range of
open-access sources curated by Our World in Data. Topics include
gender-affirming care, same-sex marriage legislation, employment
protections, censorship of LGBT+ topics, education spending, GDP, and
civil liberties.

Terminology is aligned with the United Nations' "Free and Equal"
campaign for LGBTIQ+ equality.
