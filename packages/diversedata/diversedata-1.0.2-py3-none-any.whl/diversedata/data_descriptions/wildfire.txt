Alberta Historical Wildfire Dataset (2006-2024).

This dataset contains detailed records of wildfire incidents that
occurred in Alberta, Canada, between 2006 and 2024. Each row represents
a single wildfire event, including attributes related to location, size,
cause, environmental conditions, and firefighting efforts.

general_cause : Classification of the wildfire cause.
responsible_group : Recreational group responsible for causing the wildfire.
activity_class : Activity that was going on when the wildfire started.
true_cause : Specific reason why the wildfire started (e.g., "Arson Known",
             "Hot Exhaust", "Line Impact", "Unattended Fire", etc.).
fire_start_date : Datetime the wildfire started.
detection_agent_type : Type of detection agent that discovered the wildfire
                       (e.g., lookout ("LKT"), aircraft ("AIR")).
detection_agent : Specific type of detection agent that discovered the
                  wildfire.
assessment_hectares : Size of the wildfire in hectares at the time of
                      assessment.
fire_spread_rate : Rate at which the wildfire spread in metres/minute at the
                   time of initial assessment.
fire_type : Predominant wildfire behavior classification at the time of
            initial assessment (e.g., "Surface", "Ground", "Crown").
fire_position_on_slope : Position of the wildfire relative to the slope it
                         is travelling on at the time of initial assessment
                         (e.g., "Bottom", "Middle 1/3", "Unknown").
weather_conditions_over_fire : Weather conditions over the wildfire at the
                               time of initial assessment.
temperature : Temperature at the wildfire location in Â°C at the time of
              initial assessment.
relative_humidity : Relative humidity at the wildfire location at the time
                    of initial assessment.
wind_direction : Wind direction at the wildfire location at the time of
                 initial assessment.
wind_speed : Wind speed at the wildfire location in km/hour at the time of
             initial assessment.
fuel_type : Dominant fuel type (vegetation cover) in which the wildfire is
            burning at the wildfire location at the time of initial
            assessment.
initial_action_by : Group that initiated suppression efforts.
ia_arrival_at_fire_date : Datetime when the initial action group arrived at
                          the wildfire.
ia_access : Method of access that the initial action group used.
fire_fighting_start_date : Datetime when the initial action group began
                           firefighting activities.
fire_fighting_start_size : Wildfire size at the time firefighting began in
                           hectares.
bucketing_on_fire : Whether aerial bucketing was used on the fire.
first_bh_date : Datetime when fire was first declared being held.
first_bh_size : Wildfire size when wildfire was first declared being held
                in hectares.
first_uc_date : Datetime when wildfire was first declared under control.
first_uc_size : Wildfire size when first declared under control in hectares.
first_ex_size_perimeter : Wildfire size when first declared extinguished in
                          hectares.
