How Couples Meet and Stay Together (HCMST) - 2022 Wave data.

This dataset is derived from the 2022 wave of the longitudinal HCMST
study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University. The study
explores how romantic relationships are formed and sustained in the
United States, with a focus on relationship quality, social context, and
the effects of major external events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

The dataset includes demographic characteristics, relationship context,
couple behavior, and pandemic-related experiences, making it well-suited
for studies on interpersonal dynamics, inequality, and resilience in
romantic partnerships.
