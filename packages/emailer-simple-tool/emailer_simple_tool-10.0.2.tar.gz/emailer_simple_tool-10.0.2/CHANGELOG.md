## [10.0.1] - 2025-08-16

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix
- **Text Orientation Support**: Fixed missing orientation parameter support for regular text fusion type
  - Text fusion type (`fusion-type='text'`) now properly supports the `orientation` parameter
  - Previously only `formatted-text` fusion type supported text rotation
  - Users can now rotate text using orientation values (e.g., `-90` for vertical text)
  - Implemented proper alignment handling for rotated text (left, center, right)
  - Added graceful fallback to normal text rendering if orientation value is invalid

### üîß Technical Implementation
- **Enhanced Text Rendering**: Added temporary image technique for text rotation
  - Creates temporary RGBA image for text, applies rotation, then pastes to main image
  - Maintains transparency and proper positioning after rotation
  - Consistent with existing formatted-text rotation implementation
- **Error Handling**: Added warning logging for invalid orientation values with fallback
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing text without orientation continues to work normally

### üìä Impact
- **Fixed User Issue**: Resolves reported problem where orientation parameter was ignored
- **Feature Parity**: Text and formatted-text fusion types now have consistent rotation support
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Enables vertical text, angled labels, and rotated text elements

  - Now shows proper sizes like "0.02 MB" instead of "0,0 MB"
- **Picture Project Information**: Enhanced display with comprehensive attachment details
