    Abstract base class for tests using OtelTest. No need to instantiate or call it -- just define a subclass of
    OtelTest anywhere in your script.

    The first three methods are for configuration and the second two are callbacks.

    When you run the `oteltest` command against your script, a new Python virtual environment is created with the
    configuration specified by this class's implementation. The two callbacks are then run, but not in the subprocess
    of the script, rather in the process of the oteltest command.

        Return a mapping of environment variables to their values. These will become the env vars for your script.

        Return a float indicating how long to wait in seconds for the script to finish. Once that time has elapsed,
        the subprocess running the script will be force terminated. Or return `None` to allow the script to finish on
        its own, in which case the script should shut itself down.
