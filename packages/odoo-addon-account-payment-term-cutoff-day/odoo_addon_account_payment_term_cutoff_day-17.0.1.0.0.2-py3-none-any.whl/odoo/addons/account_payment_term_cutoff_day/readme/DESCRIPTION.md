This module extends the Account Payment Terms functionality by introducing the 
fields: *has_cutoff_day*, *months*, and *cutoff_day* in `account.payment.term.line`.

With this feature, users can define a specific cutoff day for payment terms. If an 
invoice is dated after this cutoff day, the system will automatically shift the due 
date by one additional month.

The *months* field allows users to specify how many months should be added to the 
invoice date when calculating the due date.
