# AI4One ðŸ¤–

A small, modular package for machine learning.

---

## Installation


```bash
pip install ai4one
````

## Usage

### ai4one.config
The primary feature of this package is a powerful configuration system. For a comprehensive guide and examples, please see the **[Configuration System Guide](docs/config.md)**.

```python
from ai4one.config import BaseConfig, field
from typing import List

class TrainConfig(BaseConfig):
    learning_rate: float = 0.001
    epochs: int = 10
    optimizer: str = "Adam"
    layers: List[int] = [3, 3]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    config = TrainConfig.argument_parser()
    print(f"Using optimizer: {config.optimizer}")
```

You can also run the self-contained example to see it in action:

```bash
