**mc_dagprop** is a fast, Monte Carlo–style propagation simulator for directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs), written in C++ with Python bindings via **pybind11**. It
allows you to model timing networks (timetables, precedence graphs, etc.) and
inject user-defined delay distributions on edges.

Under the hood, we leverage the high-performance
[utl::random module](https://github.com/DmitriBogdanov/UTL/blob/master/docs/module_random.md)
for all pseudo-random number generation—offering better speed and quality than
the standard library.

The package provides two event-driven propagation engines. The analytic solver
implements the approach introduced by Büker and co-authors and its later
extension.[^1][^2] The Monte Carlo module follows an event-based simulation
scheme similar to the one described by De Wilde et al.[^3]
Both engines share the same Python interface and operate on an identical DAG
representation.

## Background

**mc\_dagprop** was developed as part of the
[SORRI project](https://www.ivt.ethz.ch/en/ts/projects/sorri.html) at
the Institute for Transport Planning and Systems (IVT), ETH Zurich. The SORRI project—
*Simulation-based Optimisation for Railway Robustness Improvement*
—focuses on learning real-life constraints and objectives to determine timetables optimized 
for robustness interactively. This research is supported by the
[SBB Research Fund](https://imp-sbb-lab.unisg.ch/de/research-fund/), 
which promotes innovative studies in transport management and the future of mobility in Switzerland.

## Features

- **Lightweight & high-performance** core in C++  
- Simple Python API via **poetry** or **pip**  
- Custom per-activity-type delay distributions:
  - **Constant** (linear scaling)
  - **Exponential** (scales base duration with cutoff)
  - **Gamma** (shape & scale, to scale base duration)
  - **Empirical** (absolute or relative)
    - **Absolute**: fixed values with weights
    - **Relative**: scaling factors with weights
  - Easily extendable (Weibull, etc.)  
- Single-run (`run(seed)`) and batch-run (`run_many([seeds])`), the latter releases the GIL, thus one can run it embarrassingly parallel with multithreading
- Returns a **SimResult**: realized times, per-edge durations, and causal predecessors  

> **Note:** Defining multiple distributions for the *same* `activity_type` will override previous settings.  
> Always set exactly one distribution per activity type.

## Usage

### Quickstart

```python
from mc_dagprop import (
  EventTimestamp,
  Event,
  Activity,
  DagContext,
  GenericDelayGenerator,
  Simulator,
)

# 1) Build your DAG timing context
events = [
  Event("A", EventTimestamp(0.0, 100.0, 0.0)),
  Event("B", EventTimestamp(10.0, 100.0, 0.0)),
]

activities = {
  (0, 1): Activity(idx=0, minimal_duration=60.0, activity_type=1),
}

precedence = [
  (1, [(0, 0)]),
]

ctx = DagContext(
  events=events,
  activities=activities,
  precedence_list=precedence,
  max_delay=1800.0,
)

# 2) Configure a delay generator (one per activity_type)
gen = GenericDelayGenerator()
gen.add_constant(activity_type=1, factor=1.5)  # only one call for type=1

# 3) Create simulator and run
sim = Simulator(ctx, gen)
result = sim.run(seed=42)
print("Realized times:", result.realized)
print("Edge durations:", result.durations)
print("Causal predecessors:", result.cause_event)
```

## Architecture

### Monte Carlo engine (`mc_dagprop.monte_carlo`)

Compiled extension wrapping a C++ core. Provides the `Simulator`, `GenericDelayGenerator` and
associated data structures for running Monte Carlo experiments.

### Full-distribution propagator (`mc_dagprop.analytic`)

Python implementation that propagates discrete probability mass functions deterministically. It
exposes the `AnalyticPropagator` and helper classes.

### Shared components

- `mc_dagprop.types` – typed aliases for seconds, indices and identifiers.
- `mc_dagprop.utils` – plotting and inspection utilities.

Install the package as **mc-dagprop** but import modules from the `mc_dagprop` namespace, e.g.:

```python
from mc_dagprop import Simulator
```

## API Reference

### `EventTimestamp(earliest: float, latest: float, actual: float)`

Holds the scheduling window and actual time for one event (node):

- `earliest` – earliest possible occurrence  
- `latest`   – latest allowed occurrence  
- `actual`   – scheduled (baseline) timestamp  

### `Event(id: str, timestamp: EventTimestamp)`

Wraps a DAG node with:

- `id`        – string key for the node  
- `timestamp` – an `EventTimestamp` instance  

### `Activity(idx: int, minimal_duration: float, activity_type: int)`

Represents an edge in the DAG:

- `idx`              – unique edge index
- `minimal_duration` – minimal (base) duration
- `activity_type`    – integer type identifier

### `DagContext(events, activities, precedence_list, max_delay)`

Container for your DAG:

- `events`:          `list[Event]`
- `activities`:      `dict[(src_idx, dst_idx), Activity]`
- `precedence_list`: `list[(target_idx, [(pred_idx, link_idx), …])]`
- `max_delay`:       overall cap on delay propagation
  - Can be given in any order. `Simulator` will sort topologically and raise
    a `RuntimeError` if cycles are detected.

### `GenericDelayGenerator`

Configurable delay factory (one distribution per `activity_type`):

- `.add_constant(activity_type, factor)`  
- `.add_exponential(activity_type, lambda_, max_scale)`  
- `.add_gamma(activity_type, shape, scale, max_scale=∞)`  
- `.add_empirical_absolute(activity_type, values, weights)`
- `.add_empirical_relative(activity_type, factors, weights)`
- `.set_seed(seed)`  

### `Simulator(context: DagContext, generator: GenericDelayGenerator)`

- `.run(seed: int) → SimResult`  
- `.run_many(seeds: Sequence[int]) → list[SimResult]`  

### `SimResult`

- `.realized`:   `NDArray[float]` – event times after propagation  
- `.durations`:  `NDArray[float]` – per-edge durations (base + extra)  
- `.cause_event`: `NDArray[int]` – which predecessor caused each event  

## Analytic Propagator

You can propagate discrete delay distributions analytically using `AnalyticPropagator`.
Define per-edge probability mass functions and build an `AnalyticContext`.
For example, a delay following an exponential distribution with mean `10` seconds
truncated to the range `[0, 300]` on a one-second grid can be generated with
`exponential_pmf`:

```python
from mc_dagprop.analytic import exponential_pmf

delay_pmf = exponential_pmf(scale=10.0, step=1.0, start=0.0, stop=300.0)
```

You can then use this PMF in the context definition:

```python
from mc_dagprop import (
  AnalyticContext,
  DiscretePMF,
  EventTimestamp,
  Event,
  create_analytic_propagator,
)

events = (
  Event("A", EventTimestamp(0, 10, 0)),
  Event("B", EventTimestamp(0, 10, 0)),
)
activities = {(0, 1): (0, delay_pmf)}
precedence = (
  (1, ((0, 0),)),
)
ctx = AnalyticContext(
  events=events,
  activities=activities,
  precedence_list=precedence,
  step=1.0,
)

sim = create_analytic_propagator(ctx)
pmfs = sim.run()
print(pmfs[1].values, pmfs[1].probs)
```
This computes event-time PMFs deterministically without Monte-Carlo sampling.

The ``step_size`` sets the spacing for all values in the discrete PMFs.
By default ``create_analytic_propagator()`` calls ``AnalyticContext.validate()``
before constructing the simulator and raises an error when any edge uses a
different step. All PMF value grids must therefore have constant spacing equal
to ``step_size`` and start on a multiple of that step. Pass ``validate=False``
to skip this check if you have already validated the context yourself.
Each ``Event`` may specify ``bounds=(lower, upper)`` to clip the
resulting distribution. Overflow and underflow mass can be truncated to the
closest bound, removed or redistributed across the remaining range. Control this
behaviour via the optional ``underflow_rule`` and ``overflow_rule`` arguments of
``create_analytic_propagator()``. ``TRUNCATE`` places the mass on the bound,
``REMOVE`` drops it entirely and ``REDISTRIBUTE`` reweights the other values.
The ``run()`` method returns a sequence of
``SimulatedEvent`` objects which hold the resulting PMF and the probability mass
discarded on either side. Events without predecessors are deterministic and
their PMFs collapse to a single value at the earliest bound.
By default the step size is ``1.0`` second and typical delay deviations range
roughly from ``-180`` s up to ``+1800`` s.

## Visualization Demo

```bash
pip install mc-dagprop[plot]
python demo/distribution.py
```

Displays histograms of realized times and delays.

Additional examples are available via `python -m mc_dagprop.demo.analytic` and
`python -m mc_dagprop.demo.monte_carlo`.

## Benchmarks

A lightweight benchmark helps to measure raw execution speed for a large
simulation instance. Two delay generators are provided – one constant and
one exponential – so you can compare different implementations against the
same baseline and detect performance regressions.

```bash
python benchmarks/benchmark_simulator.py
```
