**Looking for a place to start? Check out the [Unreal Containers community hub](https://unrealcontainers.com/) for implementation-agnostic information on using the Unreal Engine inside Docker containers, and then head to the [comprehensive ue4-docker documentation](https://adamrehn.github.io/ue4-docker) to view details specific to using the ue4-docker project.**

The ue4-docker Python package contains a set of Dockerfiles and accompanying build infrastructure that allows you to build Docker images for Epic Games' [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/). The images also incorporate the infrastructure from [ue4cli](https://github.com/adamrehn/ue4cli), [conan-ue4cli](https://github.com/adamrehn/conan-ue4cli), and [ue4-ci-helpers](https://github.com/adamrehn/ue4-ci-helpers) to facilitate a wide variety of use cases.

Key features include:

- The six most recent versions of the Unreal Engine are supported (currently Unreal Engine 4.27 and newer).
- Both Windows containers and Linux containers are supported.
- Building and packaging Unreal Engine projects is supported.
- Running automation tests is supported.
- Running built Unreal Engine projects with offscreen rendering is supported via the NVIDIA Container Toolkit under Linux.
