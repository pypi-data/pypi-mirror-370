# LUGACH

LU GA Canvas Helps (or LUGACH for short) is a Python application that provides a
number of utilities designed to make daily tasks more efficient for GAs at
Liberty University.

It synchronizes across Canvas, Top Hat, and Lighthouse to automate tasks such as
confirming student enrollment, retrieving emails, modifying due dates/time limits
on quizzes/assignments, and more.

## Requirements

The project currently requires Python 3.12.0 and
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to be installed. All other dependencies
are managed automatically by uv.

It's also helpful to have Git installed on your machine so that you can get
updates to the project without having to redownload the whole thing to your
computer every time.

## Installation

First, use git to clone the project to a local folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dnicholson314/LU-GA-Canvas-Helps.git
cd LU-GA-Canvas-Helps
```

(If you don't have Git, you can just download a ZIP file of the code and
extract it to a folder on your computer.)

Next, install the dependencies and the CLI using uv:

```bash
uv tool install . -e
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the project from anywhere using the CLI command:

```bash
lugach
```

**The first time you run the project, you should open the Setup application**:

```txt
    Welcome to LUGACH! Please choose one of the following options (or 'q' to
quit): 
        (1) Setup **this option here**
        (2) Identify Absent Students
        (3) Identify Quiz Concerns
        (4) Modify Due Dates
        (5) Modify Time Limits
        (6) Post Final Grades
        (7) Search Student By Name
        (8) Update Attendance Verification
        (9) Modify Attendance
```

That application will let you add the various authentication details you need
for various aspects of the project.
