    Represents a minimal peer information object commonly used in Bale messaging events.

    This class typically appears in contexts where only the user ID and possibly the chat type
    are known or required (e.g., identifying who performed an action).

    Note:
        All date or time fields in the Bale API are represented as millisecond timestamps.
        Although this class currently does not have date fields, this is important for other related models.

    """
    The type of chat (e.g., user, group, channel).
    
    This field is optional because sometimes only the ID is provided, and type inference
    or external context is required to interpret the peer correctly.
