    Base class for standard responses in the Bale messaging protocol.

    - `seq`: a sequence number for tracking message or request order.
    - `date`: a millisecond-based timestamp representing the server time 
      when the response was generated.

    These fields are typically included in nearly all API responses from Bale.
