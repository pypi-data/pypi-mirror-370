    Represents a reaction on a Bale message or entity.

    This class stores information about which users reacted,
    the emoji used, and the count of reactions.

    Fields correspond to the raw data keys using aliases for parsing
    from Bale's internal protocol.

    The `users` field contains a list of user IDs who reacted.
    The `emojy` field stores the emoji string representing the reaction.
    The `count` field indicates how many times this reaction was made.

    The validator decodes user IDs from a varint-encoded format
    and extracts the count from a nested structure.
