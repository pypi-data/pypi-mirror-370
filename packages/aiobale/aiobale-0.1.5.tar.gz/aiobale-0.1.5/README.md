### ⚡ What is Aiobale?

**Aiobale** is an asynchronous Python library for accessing **Bale’s internal gRPC API** — built entirely from scratch, without `.proto` files or official documentation.

It transforms the raw complexity of Bale’s encrypted Protobuf-based network into **simple, Pythonic classes and methods** — ready for real-world use.

---

## ✨ Features

- 💬 Asynchronous, fast, and non-blocking — built on top of **aiohttp**
- 🔎 Works directly with **Bale’s internal gRPC API**
- 🔄 Supports phone login, messaging, bots, presence, files, and more
- 🧠 Clean, readable API with type hints and smart data classes
- ⚙️ Handler-based routing with decorators (inspired by modern bot frameworks)
- 🌙 Reverse-engineered from the web client, no official help
- 🛠 Built by one determined developer — with room to grow!

> 🎯 **Use Cases**: Build bots, track stats, explore Bale’s ecosystem, automate tasks, and more.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install aiobale
````

Or get the latest development version from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Enalite/aiobale.git
```

---

> ⚠️ **Please Read Carefully**

Bale’s official client uses `POST` gRPC requests **primarily for a few authentication methods**.
Excessive use of such requests for **non-authentication purposes** (e.g., messaging, presence, media) may raise flags, result in **rate limiting**, or even lead to **temporary bans**.

**Aiobale is provided as-is, without any guarantees or endorsement from Bale.**
It is intended strictly for **educational and ethical use** — please avoid any misuse, such as spam, scraping, or violating Bale’s terms of service.

## 🪄 Example: Echo Bot in 10 Lines

Here’s a minimal bot that replies with the same message (and echoes back documents too):

```python
import asyncio
from aiobale import Client, Dispatcher
from aiobale.types import Message

dp = Dispatcher()
client = Client(dp)

@dp.message()
async def echo(msg: Message):
    if content := msg.content.document:
        return await msg.answer_document(content, use_own_content=True)
    elif text := msg.text:
        return await msg.answer(text)
    await msg.answer("Nothing to echo!")

async def main():
    await client.start()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 🤝 Final Words

Aiobale is **more than just a library** — it's a gateway to the inner workings of a unique messaging ecosystem.
If you enjoy diving into internals, decoding protocols, and building tools that weren't supposed to exist — you're in the right place.

Let’s shape the future of unofficial Bale tooling — together.
