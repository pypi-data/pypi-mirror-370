MLflow auth plugin to use OpenID Connect (OIDC) as authentication and authorization provider.

This plugin allows you to use OIDC for user management in MLflow, enabling single sign-on (SSO) capabilities and centralized user management.

### Features
- OIDC-based authentication for MLflow UI and API
- User management through OIDC provider
- User-level access control
- Group-based access control
- Permissions management based on regular expressions (allows or denies access to specific MLflow resources based on regular expressions and assigns permissions to users or groups)
- Support for session, JWT, and basic authentication methods
- Compatible with mlflow-client (basic auth)
