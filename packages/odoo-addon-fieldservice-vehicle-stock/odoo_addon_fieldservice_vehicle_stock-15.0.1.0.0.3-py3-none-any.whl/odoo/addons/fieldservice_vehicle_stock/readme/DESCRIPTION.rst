This module is an add-on for the Field Service application in Odoo.
It allows you to establish stock locations for field service vehicles
and process stock moves with field service vehicles.

In field service operations, the general flow of inventory is as follows:
Stock Location -> Vehicle Location -> Customer Location

This module will automatically update pickings linked to field service orders, ensuring that inventory is moved to the correct vehicle storage locations. These pickings have to be of an operation type that is used to load or unload a vehicle.
