This module is an add-on for the Field Service application in Odoo.
It allows you to establish stock locations for field service vehicles
and process stock moves with field service vehicles.

In field service operations, the general flow of inventory is as follows:
Stock Location -> Vehicle Location -> Customer Location

This module will automatically update pickings linked to field service orders, ensuring that inventory is moved to the correct vehicle storage locations. These pickings have to be of an operation type that is used to load or unload a vehicle.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

# Configure Operation Types for Loading FSM Vehicles
Specific stock operation types can be configured for
moving inventory to the storage locations of FSM Vehicles.
Moves will not be processed if the FSM Vehicle is not set on
the transfers of these operation types.
#. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Operation Types
#. Select or Create an Operation Type
#. Check the box "Used to Load a Field Service Vehicle"

# Verify procurement routes
Some new procurement routes are added with this module. Check
that these routes fit your individual business needs or you can
create new ones.

Be sure to have a rule that utilizes an Operation Type that is
configured for FSM Vehicle Loading and the rule has a Destination
Location which is a parent of the FSM Vehicle inventory location

# Configure FSM Vehicles
Each FSM Vehicle that will carry inventory needs to have a
stock inventory location.  Individual vehicle inventory
locations should be a descendant location of a procurement
rule's Destination Location.
#. Go to Field Service > Master Data > Vehicles
#. Select or Create a Field Service Vehicle
#. Set the desired Inventory Location for that vehicle

Usage
=====

1. **Create a Location for the Vehicle**
- Navigate to Inventory > Configuration > Locations and create a new location.
- Set a name.
- Set the `Parent Location` to `Vehicles`.
- Set the location type to `Internal Location`.
- Save the location.

2. **Create an FSM Vehicle**
- Navigate to Field Service > Master Data > Vehicles and create a new vehicle.
- Set a name.
- Assign a driver.
- Assign the location you created in step 1.
- Save the vehicle.
- Enter the driver's record and set the `Default Vehicle` field to the vehicle you just created.

3. **Generate Stock Moves**
- Navigate to Inventory > Operations > Transfers and create a new transfer.
- On the `Operation Type` field, select an operation type that supports FSM vehicle loading or unloading. Examples of this include `Vehicle Loading`, to load a vehicle from stock, and `Location Delivery`, to unload a vehicle to a customer location.
- Add the products you want to transfer and save the transfer.
- By default, the Source Location or Destination Location (depending on the selected operation type) will be set to the default `Vehicles` location.

4. **Validate the Transfer**
- In the `Additional Info` tab, set the FSM Vehicle on the transfer.
- If you link an FSM order to the transfer, and the FSM order has a vehicle assigned with a storage location that is a child of the `Vehicles` location, the vehicle and its corresponding location will be automatically set on the transfer.
- When validating the picking, the destination location of the picking and it's move lines will be updated to the vehicle's storage location. The assigned products will be moved from or to the vehicle location, depending on the selected operation type.
- If you try to confirm a transfer without setting the FSM Vehicle, an error will be raised.
- If you try to set a vehicle or link an FSM order with a vehicle whose storage location is not a child of the Vehicles location, an error will be raised.
