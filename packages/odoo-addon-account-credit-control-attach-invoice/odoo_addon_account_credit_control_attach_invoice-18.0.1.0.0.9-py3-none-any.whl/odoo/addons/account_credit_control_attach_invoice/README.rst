This module enhances the Odoo Credit Control process by allowing users
to automatically attach detailed customer invoice reports to each credit
control summary. When printing or sending a credit control summary
(reminder) to a customer, the selected invoice report is merged into the
same PDF document, providing a complete overview of outstanding credits
and the underlying invoices in a single file.

Configuration
=============

Configuration Steps
-------------------

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure that the ``account_credit_control`` module
   is installed and configured in your Odoo database.
2. **Module Installation**: Install this module
   (``account_credit_control_attach_invoice``) via the Apps menu.
3. **Configure Report to Attach**:

   - Go to the Accounting\\Invoicing app.
   - Open the Configuration settings.
   - In the Credit Control section, locate the "Report to attach" field.
   - Select the invoice report you want to merge with credit control
     summaries (e.g., Customer Invoice, Invoice with Payments, etc.).
   - Save your settings.

Usage
=====

1. Create or select a Credit Control Run from the *Credit Control Run*
   menu in the Accounting\\Invoicing app.
2. Use the *Compute Credit Lines* button to generate credit control
   lines for overdue invoices.
3. Review the generated credit control lines. Each line represents an
   invoice or receivable to follow up.
4. When ready to communicate with customers, print or send the Credit
   Control Summary report from the run.
5. The system will automatically merge the selected invoice report (as
   configured) into the credit control summary PDF for each customer, so
   recipients receive both the summary and detailed invoices in one
   document.
6. Download, print, or send the combined report as needed.
