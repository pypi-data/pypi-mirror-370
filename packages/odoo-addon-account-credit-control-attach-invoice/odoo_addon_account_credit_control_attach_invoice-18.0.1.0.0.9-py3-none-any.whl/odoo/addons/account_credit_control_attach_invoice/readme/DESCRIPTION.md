This module enhances the Odoo Credit Control process by allowing users to automatically attach detailed customer invoice reports to each credit control summary. When printing or sending a credit control summary (reminder) to a customer, the selected invoice report is merged into the same PDF document, providing a complete overview of outstanding credits and the underlying invoices in a single file.
