1. Create or select a Credit Control Run from the *Credit Control Run* menu in the Accounting\Invoicing app.
2. Use the *Compute Credit Lines* button to generate credit control lines for overdue invoices.
3. Review the generated credit control lines. Each line represents an invoice or receivable to follow up.
4. When ready to communicate with customers, print or send the Credit Control Summary report from the run.
5. The system will automatically merge the selected invoice report (as configured) into the credit control summary PDF for each customer, so recipients receive both the summary and detailed invoices in one document.
6. Download, print, or send the combined report as needed.
