    """
    The CatalogClient handles the HTTP communication with the EarthOne catalog.
    It is almost sufficient to use the default client that is automatically retrieved
    using `get_default_client`.  However, if you want to adjust e.g.  the retries, you
    can create your own.

    Parameters
    ----------
    url : str, optional
        The URL to use when connecting to the EarthOne catalog.  Only change
        this if you are being asked to use a non-default EarthOne catalog.  If
        not set, then ``earthdaily.earthone.config.get_settings().CATALOG_V2_URL`` will be used.
    auth : Auth, optional
        The authentication object used when connecting to the EarthOne catalog.
        This is typically the default :class:`~earthdaily.earthone.auth.Auth` object that uses
        the cached authentication
        token retrieved with the shell command "$ earthone auth login".
    retries : int, optional
        The number of retries when there is a problem with the connection.  Set this to
        zero to disable retries.  The default is 3 retries.
