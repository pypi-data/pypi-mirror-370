"""EarthOne Python Client

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install earthdaily-earthone[complete]

Documentation is available at https://earthone.earthdaily.com/docs.

Source code and version information is at
https://github.com/earthdaily/earthone-python.

The EarthOne Platform simplifies analysis of **global-scale raster data**
by providing:

    * Access to a catalog of petabytes of disparate geospatial data,
      all normalized and interoperable through one **common interface**
    * A Python client library to access these systems
"""

# This is required in order to support namespace packages
# PEP420 is not sufficient because of legacy usage patterns
# and the three levels of earthdaily, earthdaily.earthone,
# and earthdaily.earthone.dynamic_compute all being packaged
# separately.
