# Hamplots

### Hamplots
Produces various plots based on current ham radio band conditions, based on reports from pskreporter.
Currently set up to support this repository, which uses GitHub actions to update the plots periodically and put them on the web, 
for example: [this page](https://g1ojs.github.io/hamplots/docs/heatmaps.html).

However, you can install and run the Python used to generate the plots and use it yourself.

### Installation:

```
pip install hamplots
```

### More coming soon
