# Installtion
This module interfaces with the [ArrayFire](https://arrayfire.org/docs/installing.htm#gsc.tab=0) library (version 3.8.0).
To ensure proper functionality, make sure the ArrayFire shared libraries are discoverable by the system. You can do this by updating your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/arrayfire/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Then to install the latest version of the package from PyPI, simply run:
```
pip install somu
```

# Usage
```python
from somu import som
from numpy import random

data = random.rand(1000, 2)
som(data, (10, 10))
```

# Demo requirements
Before running the demos make sure to have the required packages installed:
```
pip install -r demos/requirements.txt
```
