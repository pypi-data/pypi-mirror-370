# CloudOps Runbooks: Security Baseline Assessment

## üìñ Overview

The **CloudOps Runbooks: Security Baseline Assessment** is a comprehensive tool designed to evaluate the security of AWS environments in accordance with basic security advisories. It provides a structured way to assess your account and workload configurations against **AWS security best practices** and the **AWS Startup Security Baseline (SSB)**. This tool supports **Python (via pip or Docker)** and **AWS Lambda** deployments, offering flexibility for local testing, CI/CD integration, and scalable cloud execution.

By automating **15+ critical AWS account security and workload security checks**, this solution empowers startups, enterprises, and DevOps teams to validate their cloud security posture, generate actionable reports, and align with AWS Well-Architected principles.

In the **Test Report**, we provide numerous techniques for successfully responding to security threats on AWS with minimal resources. This script is appropriate for usage by early-stage businesses that cannot afford to invest much in security.¬†


## ‚ú® Features: Core Capabilities

1. **Account and Workload Security Checks**:
   - Validates IAM configurations, S3 bucket policies, VPC security groups, and CloudTrail settings.
2. **Report Generation**:
   - Generates **multi-language HTML reports** (English, Korean, Japanese).
3. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Provides remediation steps for failed checks, mapped to AWS documentation.
4. **Flexible Deployment**:
   - Usable as a Python library (pip), containerized application (Docker), or AWS Lambda function.
5. **Read-Only Permissions**:
   - Ensures compliance with AWS's **least privilege principle** for non-intrusive diagnostics.

## FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions

### **1. How can I test additional security items to enhance AWS account security?**

To test a broader range of security configurations, consider using [AWS Trusted Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-trusted-advisor-new-priority-capability/).
This service regularly analyzes your AWS accounts and helps you implement AWS security best practices aligned with the AWS Well-Architected Framework. By managing your security settings through Trusted Advisor, you can systematically improve the security posture of your AWS environment.

---

### **2. Where can I find more information or guidelines to improve AWS security?**

AWS provides the [AWS Well-Architected Tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/intro.html), a comprehensive cloud service for evaluating and optimizing your architecture.
This tool includes a **Security Pillar**, which outlines detailed best practices for securing your AWS workloads. Use these guidelines to design, assess, and enhance your security strategy effectively.

---

### **3. Can I scan multiple AWS accounts within the same AWS Organization simultaneously?**

No, this script currently supports scanning a **single AWS account** at a time.
To scan additional AWS accounts in the same organization, you must:
- Create a separate IAM user with the required permissions in each account.
- Run the script individually for each account.

**Note**: Organization-level security settings cannot be assessed using this script. Consider AWS services like **AWS Organizations** for managing policies at scale.

---

### **4. Can I use this script without an IAM Access Key?**

Yes, you can run the script without an IAM Access Key by leveraging IAM roles.
Starting from the **01/Aug/2023**, you can configure and use **IAM Roles** instead of access keys.

Follow these steps:
1. Refer to [Overview of using IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html#cli-role-overview) to configure a role profile in the AWS CLI.
2. Execute the script with the `--profile` option as shown below:

```bash
python3 run_script.py --profile PROFILE_NAME --language EN
```

This approach enhances security by reducing the dependency on long-term access keys.
