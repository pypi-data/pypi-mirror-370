# ccfit2

`ccfit2` is a package for working with magnetometry data, specifically those from AC susceptibility, DC decay, and DC Waveform measurements.

Although the main use of `ccfit2` is to extract and later fit temperature/field dependent relaxation rate data from these experiments, the modular nature
of `ccfit2` means that the user is free to include any of `ccfit2`'s functionality in their own work.

## Documentation and Installation

To get started, head to the online documentation for `ccfit2` [here](https://chilton-group.gitlab.io/cc-fit2/).

## Developers

Install in editable mode by running

```
pip install -e .
```

in the repository HEAD.

## Reference

We request that any data processed with `ccfit2` is accompanied by the version number (obtained with `pip show ccfit2`)  and **both** of the following citations
