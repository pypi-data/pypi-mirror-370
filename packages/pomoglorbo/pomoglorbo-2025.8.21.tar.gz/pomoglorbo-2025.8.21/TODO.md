# Improve socket server

Ideas:

- Show whether socket server is running in the UI

# Remove setup.py

Setuptools is not a popular choice for Python packaging anymore.

# Show how long since a break or whatever has started

Useful when going over the given break time and wanting to know how much
one has gone over.

# DONE

## Allow passing commands along

I want to be able to start pomoglorbo with the tags I want to use for
timewarror.
