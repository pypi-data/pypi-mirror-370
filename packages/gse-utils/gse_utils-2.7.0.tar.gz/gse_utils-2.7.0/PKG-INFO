# gse-utils

Common utility functions used by various GSE scripts.

The various packaging operations (adding and checking dependencies, building wheels/sdists and so on) are done with [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/) because it simplifies the workflow. That is not a requirement though, the usual Python tools should be usable without issues.
