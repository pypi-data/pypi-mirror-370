        r"""Initialization for the FileCache class.

        Parameters:
            cache_name: By default, the file cache will be stored in the subdirectory
                ``_filecache_global`` under the `cache_root` directory. If a name is
                specified explicitly, the file cache will be stored in the subdirectory
                ``_filecache_<cache_name>``. Explicitly naming a cache is useful if other
                programs will want to access the same cache, or if you want the directory
                name to be obvious to users browsing the file system. Using a cache name
                (including the default ``global``) implies that this cache should be
                persistent on exit. If you pass in ``None``, the cache will instead be
                stored in a uniquely-named subdirectory with the prefix ``_filecache_``
                and by default will be deleted on exit.
            cache_root: The directory in which to place caches. By default,
                :class:`FileCache` uses the contents of the environment variable
                ``FILECACHE_CACHE_ROOT``; if not set, then the system temporary directory
                is used, which involves checking the environment variables ``TMPDIR``,
                ``TEMP``, and ``TMP``, and if none of those are set then using
                ``C:\TEMP``, ``C:\TMP``, ``\TEMP``, or ``\TMP`` on Windows and ``/tmp``,
                ``/var/tmp``, or ``/usr/tmp`` on other platforms. The cache will be stored
                in a sub-directory within this directory (see `cache_name`). If
                `cache_root` is specified but the directory does not exist, it is created.
            delete_on_exit: If True, the cache directory and its contents
                are always deleted on program exit or exit from a :class:`FileCache`
                context manager. If False, the cache is never deleted. By default, an
                unnamed cache (`cache_name` is ``None``) will be deleted on exit and a
                named cache will not be deleted on program exit.
            time_sensitive: If True, the modification time of files in the cache is
                considered to be important. When a file is retrieved, the modification
                time from the source location is set on the local copy. If a local copy
                already exists, the times on both copies are compared and the local copy
                is updated if the source is newer. When a file is uploaded, the
                modification time on the local copy is set to the time retrieved from the
                source after the upload is complete.
            cache_metadata: If True, :meth:`iterdir`, :meth:`iterdir_metadata`, and other
                internal methods will cache the metadata (such as modification time, size,
                and `is_dir`) of remote files. If `time_sensitive` is True and
                :meth:`retrieve` needs the modification time of a file to compare to the
                local file, it will be retrieved from the cache if possible to save a
                server query. This option should only be used if the remote source is
                guaranteed not to change during the lifetime of this :class:`FileCache`
                instance.
            mp_safe: If False, never use multiprocessor-safe locking. If True, always use
                multiprocessor-safe locking. By default, locking is used if `cache_name`
                is specified, as it is assumed that multiple processes will be using the
                named cache simultaneously. If multiple processes will not be using the
                cache simultaneously, a small performance boost can be realized by setting
                `mp_safe` explicitly to False.
            anonymous: The default value for anonymous access to cloud resources.
                If True, access cloud resources without specifying credentials. If False,
                credentials must be initialized in the program's environment.
            lock_timeout: The default value for lock timeouts. This is how long to wait,
                in seconds, if another process is marked as retrieving a file before
                raising an exception. 0 means to not wait at all. A negative value means
                to never time out.
            nthreads: The default value for the maximum number of threads to use when
                doing multiple-file retrieval, upload, or other file operations.
            url_to_url: The default function (or list of functions) that is used to
                translate URLs into URLs. A user-specified translator function takes three
                arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str) -> str

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, and `path` is the rest of the URL. If the translator wants to
                override the default translation, it can return a new complete URL as a
                string. Otherwise, it returns None. If more than one translator is
                specified, they are called in order until one returns a URL, or it falls
                through to the default.

                If this parameter is specified, it replaces the default translators for
                this :class:`FileCache` instance. If this parameter is omitted, the
                default translators are used.
            url_to_path: The default function (or list of functions) that is used to
                translate URLs into local paths. By default, :class:`FileCache` uses a
                directory hierarchy consisting of
                ``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>/<source>/<path>``, where ``source`` is the URL
                prefix converted to a filesystem-friendly format (e.g. ``gs://bucket`` is
                converted to ``gs_bucket``). A user-specified translator function takes
                five arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str, cache_dir: Path,
                         cache_subdir: str) -> str | Path

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, `path` is the rest of the URL, `cache_dir` is the top-level
                directory of the cache (``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>``), and `cache_subdir`
                is the subdirectory specific to this scheme and remote. If the translator
                wants to override the default translation, it can return a Path.
                Otherwise, it returns None. If the returned Path is relative, if will be
                appended to `cache_dir`; if it is absolute, it will be used directly (be
                very careful with this, as it has the ability to access files outside of
                the cache directory). If more than one translator is specified, they are
                called in order until one returns a Path, or it falls through to the
                default. Note that `url_to_path` operates on the original URL, not the
                URL generated by a `url_to_url` translator.
            logger: If False, do not do any logging. If None, use the
                global logger set with :func:`set_global_logger`. Otherwise use the
                specified logger.

        Notes:
            :class:`FileCache` can be used as a context, such as::

                with FileCache(cache_name=None) as fc:
                    ...

            In this case, the cache directory is created on entry to the context and
            deleted on exit. However, if the cache is named, the directory will not be
            deleted on exit unless the ``delete_on_exit=True`` option is used.

                tuple, all URLs are processed.
            anonymous: If True, access cloud resources without specifying credentials. If
                False, credentials must be initialized in the program's environment. If
                None, use the default setting for this :class:`FileCache` instance.
            create_parents: If True, create all parent directories. This
                is useful when getting the local path of a file that will be uploaded.
            url_to_url: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate URLs
                into URLs. A user-specified translator function takes three arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str) -> str

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, and `path` is the rest of the URL. If the translator wants to
                override the default translation, it can return a new complete URL as a
                string. Otherwise, it returns None. If more than one translator is
                specified, they are called in order until one returns a URL, or it falls
                through to the default.

                If this parameter is specified, it replaces the default translators for
                this :class:`FileCache` instance. If this parameter is omitted, the
                default translators are used.
            url_to_path: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate
                URLs into local paths. By default, :class:`FileCache` uses a directory
                hierarchy consisting of ``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>/<source>/<path>``,
                where ``source`` is the URL prefix converted to a filesystem-friendly
                format (e.g. ``gs://bucket`` is converted to ``gs_bucket``). A
                user-specified translator function takes five arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str, cache_dir: Path,
                         cache_subdir: str) -> str | Path

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, `path` is the rest of the URL, `cache_dir` is the top-level
                directory of the cache (``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>``), and `cache_subdir`
                is the subdirectory specific to this scheme and remote. If the translator
                wants to override the default translation, it can return a Path.
                Otherwise, it returns None. If the returned Path is relative, if will be
                appended to `cache_dir`; if it is absolute, it will be used directly (be
                very careful with this, as it has the ability to access files outside of
                the cache directory). If more than one translator is specified, they are
                called in order until one returns a Path, or it falls through to the
                default. Note that `url_to_path` operates on the original URL, not the
                URL generated by a `url_to_url` translator.

                If this parameter is specified, it replaces the default translators for
                this :class:`FileCache` instance. If this parameter is omitted, the
                default translators are used.

        Returns:
            The Path (or list of Paths) of the filename in the temporary directory, or as
            specified by the `url_to_path` translators. The files do not have to exist
            because a Path could be used for writing a file to upload. To facilitate this,
            a side effect of this call (if `create_parents` is True) is that the complete
            parent directory structure will be created for each returned Path.

        Parameters:

                tuple, all URLs are checked. This may be more efficient because files can
                be checked in parallel. It is OK to check files from multiple sources
                using one call.
            anonymous: If specified, override the default setting for anonymous access.
                If True, access cloud resources without specifying credentials. If False,
                credentials must be initialized in the program's environment.
            nthreads: The maximum number of threads to use. If None, use the default value
                for this :class:`FileCache` instance.
            exception_on_fail: If True, if any file does not exist a FileNotFound
                exception is raised. If False, the function returns normally and any
                failed check is marked with the Exception that caused the failure in place
                of the returned modification time.
            url_to_url: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate URLs
                into URLs. A user-specified translator function takes three arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str) -> str

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, and `path` is the rest of the URL. If the translator wants to
                override the default translation, it can return a new complete URL as a
                string. Otherwise, it returns None. If more than one translator is
                specified, they are called in order until one returns a URL, or it falls
                through to the default.

                If this parameter is specified, it replaces the default translators for
                this :class:`FileCache` instance. If this parameter is omitted, the
                default translators are used.

        Returns:
            The modification time as a Unix timestamp if the file exists and the time can
            be retrieved, None otherwise. If `url` was a list or tuple, then instead
            return a list of modification times in order. This always returns the
            modification time of the file on the remote source, even if there is a local
            copy. If you want the modification time of the local copy, you can call the
            normal ``stat`` function. If `cache_metadata` is True, the modification time
            is retrieved from the cache if possible to save a server query. If
            `exception_on_fail` is False, any modification time may be an Exception if
            that file does not exist or the modification time cannot be retrieved.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If a file does not exist.

        """Retrieve file(s) from the given location(s) and store in the file cache.

        Parameters:
            url: The URL of the file, including any source prefix. If `url` is a list or
                tuple, all URLs are retrieved. This may be more efficient because files
                can be downloaded in parallel. It is OK to retrieve files from multiple
                sources using one call.
            anonymous: If True, access cloud resources without specifying credentials. If
                False, credentials must be initialized in the program's environment. If
                None, use the default setting for this :class:`FileCache` instance.
            lock_timeout: How long to wait, in seconds, if another process is marked as
                retrieving the file before raising an exception. 0 means to not wait at
                all. A negative value means to never time out. None means to use the
                default value for this :class:`FileCache` instance.
            nthreads: The maximum number of threads to use when doing multiple-file
                retrieval or upload. If None, use the default value for this
                :class:`FileCache` instance.
            exception_on_fail: If True, if any file does not exist or download fails a
                FileNotFound exception is raised, and if any attempt to acquire a lock or
                wait for another process to download a file fails a TimeoutError is
                raised. If False, the function returns normally and any failed download is
                marked with the Exception that caused the failure in place of the returned
                Path.
            url_to_url: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate URLs
                into URLs. A user-specified translator function takes three arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str) -> str

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, and `path` is the rest of the URL. If the translator wants to
                override the default translation, it can return a new complete URL as a
                string. Otherwise, it returns None. If more than one translator is
                specified, they are called in order until one returns a URL, or it falls
                through to the default.

                If this parameter is specified, it replaces the default translators for
                this :class:`FileCache` instance. If this parameter is omitted, the
                default translators are used.
            url_to_path: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate
                URLs into local paths. By default, :class:`FileCache` uses a directory
                hierarchy consisting of ``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>/<source>/<path>``,
                where ``source`` is the URL prefix converted to a filesystem-friendly
                format (e.g. ``gs://bucket`` is converted to ``gs_bucket``). A
                user-specified translator function takes five arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str, cache_dir: Path,
                         cache_subdir: str) -> str | Path

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, `path` is the rest of the URL, `cache_dir` is the top-level
                directory of the cache (``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>``), and `cache_subdir`
                is the subdirectory specific to this scheme and remote. If the translator
                wants to override the default translation, it can return a Path.
                Otherwise, it returns None. If the returned Path is relative, if will be
                appended to `cache_dir`; if it is absolute, it will be used directly (be
                very careful with this, as it has the ability to access files outside of
                the cache directory). If more than one translator is specified, they are
                called in order until one returns a Path, or it falls through to the
                default. Note that `url_to_path` operates on the original URL, not the
                URL generated by a `url_to_url` translator.

                If this parameter is specified, it replaces the default translators for
                this :class:`FileCache` instance. If this parameter is omitted, the
                default translators are used.

        Returns:
            The Path of the filename in the temporary directory (or the original absolute
            path if local). If `url` was a list or tuple, then instead return a list of
            Paths of the filenames in the temporary directory (or the original absolute
            path if local). If `exception_on_fail` is False, any Path may be an Exception
            if that file does not exist or the download failed or a timeout occurred.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If a file does not exist or could not be downloaded, and
                exception_on_fail is True.
            TimeoutError: If we could not acquire the lock to allow downloading of a file
                within the given timeout or, for a multi-file download, if we timed out
                waiting for other processes to download locked files, and
                exception_on_fail is True.

        Notes:
            File download is normally an atomic operation; a program will never see a
            partially-downloaded file, and if a download is interrupted there will be no
            file present. However, when downloading multiple files at the same time, as
            many files as possible are downloaded before an exception is raised.

                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, and `path` is the rest of the URL. If the translator wants to
                override the default translation, it can return a new complete URL as a
                string. Otherwise, it returns None. If more than one translator is
                specified, they are called in order until one returns a URL, or it falls
                through to the default.

                If this parameter is specified, it replaces the default translators for
                this :class:`FileCache` instance. If this parameter is omitted, the
                default translators are used.
            url_to_path: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate
                URLs into local paths. By default, :class:`FileCache` uses a directory
                hierarchy consisting of ``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>/<source>/<path>``,
                where ``source`` is the URL prefix converted to a filesystem-friendly
                format (e.g. ``gs://bucket`` is converted to ``gs_bucket``). A
                user-specified translator function takes five arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str, cache_dir: Path,
                         cache_subdir: str) -> str | Path

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, `path` is the rest of the URL, `cache_dir` is the top-level
                directory of the cache (``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>``), and `cache_subdir`
                is the subdirectory specific to this scheme and remote. If the translator
                wants to override the default translation, it can return a Path.
                Otherwise, it returns None. If the returned Path is relative, if will be
                appended to `cache_dir`; if it is absolute, it will be used directly (be
                very careful with this, as it has the ability to access files outside of
                the cache directory). If more than one translator is specified, they are
                called in order until one returns a Path, or it falls through to the
                default. Note that `url_to_path` operates on the original URL, not the
                URL generated by a `url_to_url` translator.

                If this parameter is specified, it replaces the default translators for
                this :class:`FileCache` instance. If this parameter is omitted, the
                default translators are used.

        Returns:
            The Path of the filename in the cache directory (or the original absolute path
            if local). If `url` was a list or tuple of paths, then instead return a list
            of Paths of the filenames in the temporary directory (or the original full
            path if local). If `exception_on_fail` is False, any Path may be an Exception
            if that file does not exist or the upload failed.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If a file to upload does not exist or the upload failed,
                and exception_on_fail is True.

        Notes:
            If `time_sensitive` is True for this :class:`FileCache` instance, then the
            modification time of the local file is set to the modification time of the
            remote file after the upload is complete. If `time_sensitive` is False, then
            the modification time of the local file is not changed.

            url_to_url: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate URLs

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, and `path` is the rest of the URL. If the translator wants to
                override the default translation, it can return a new complete URL as a
                string. Otherwise, it returns None. If more than one translator is
                specified, they are called in order until one returns a URL, or it falls
                through to the default.

                If this parameter is specified, it replaces the default translators for
                this :class:`FileCache` instance. If this parameter is omitted, the
                default translators are used.
            url_to_path: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate
                URLs into local paths. By default, :class:`FileCache` uses a directory
                hierarchy consisting of ``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>/<source>/<path>``,
                where ``source`` is the URL prefix converted to a filesystem-friendly
                format (e.g. ``gs://bucket`` is converted to ``gs_bucket``). A
                user-specified translator function takes five arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str, cache_dir: Path,
                         cache_subdir: str) -> str | Path

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, `path` is the rest of the URL, `cache_dir` is the top-level
                directory of the cache (``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>``), and `cache_subdir`
                is the subdirectory specific to this scheme and remote. If the translator
                wants to override the default translation, it can return a Path.
                Otherwise, it returns None. If the returned Path is relative, if will be
                appended to `cache_dir`; if it is absolute, it will be used directly (be
                very careful with this, as it has the ability to access files outside of
                the cache directory). If more than one translator is specified, they are
                called in order until one returns a Path, or it falls through to the
                default. Note that `url_to_path` operates on the original URL, not the
                URL generated by a `url_to_url` translator.

                If this parameter is specified, it replaces the default translators for

            url_to_path: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate
                URLs into local paths. By default, :class:`FileCache` uses a directory
                hierarchy consisting of ``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>/<source>/<path>``,
                where ``source`` is the URL prefix converted to a filesystem-friendly
                format (e.g. ``gs://bucket`` is converted to ``gs_bucket``). A
                user-specified translator function takes five arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str, cache_dir: Path,
                         cache_subdir: str) -> str | Path

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, `path` is the rest of the URL, `cache_dir` is the top-level
                directory of the cache (``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>``), and `cache_subdir`
                is the subdirectory specific to this scheme and remote. If the translator
                wants to override the default translation, it can return a Path.
                Otherwise, it returns None. If the returned Path is relative, if will be
                appended to `cache_dir`; if it is absolute, it will be used directly (be
                very careful with this, as it has the ability to access files outside of
                the cache directory). If more than one translator is specified, they are
                called in order until one returns a Path, or it falls through to the
                default. Note that `url_to_path` operates on the original URL, not the
                URL generated by a `url_to_url` translator.

                If this parameter is specified, it replaces the default translators for
                this :class:`FileCache` instance. If this parameter is omitted, the
                default translators are used.

        Returns:
            The Path of the filename in the cache directory (or the original absolute path
            if local). If `url` was a list or tuple of paths, then instead return a list
            of Paths of the filenames in the temporary directory (or the original full
            path if local). If `exception_on_fail` is False, any Path may be an Exception
            if that file does not exist and missing_ok is True.

        Notes:
            If a URL points to a remote location, the locally cached version (if any) is
            only removed if the unlink of the remote location succeeded.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If a file to unlink does not exist or the unlink failed,
                and exception_on_fail is True.

                None, use the default setting for this :class:`FileCache` instance.
            lock_timeout: How long to wait, in seconds, if another process is marked as
                retrieving the file before raising an exception. 0 means to not wait at
                all. A negative value means to never time out. None means to use the
                default value for this :class:`FileCache` instance.

                retrieval or upload. If None, use the default value for this
                :class:`FileCache` instance.
            url_to_url: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate URLs
                into URLs. A user-specified translator function takes three arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str) -> str

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, and `path` is the rest of the URL. If the translator wants to
                override the default translation, it can return a new complete URL as a
                string. Otherwise, it returns None. If more than one translator is
                specified, they are called in order until one returns a URL, or it falls
                through to the default.

                If None, use the default translators for this :class:`FileCache` instance.
            url_to_path: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate
                URLs into local paths. By default, :class:`FileCache` uses a directory
                hierarchy consisting of ``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>/<source>/<path>``,
                where ``source`` is the URL prefix converted to a filesystem-friendly
                format (e.g. ``gs://bucket`` is converted to ``gs_bucket``). A
                user-specified translator function takes five arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str, cache_dir: Path,
                         cache_subdir: str) -> str | Path

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, `path` is the rest of the URL, `cache_dir` is the top-level
                directory of the cache (``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>``), and `cache_subdir`
                is the subdirectory specific to this scheme and remote. If the translator
                wants to override the default translation, it can return a Path.
                Otherwise, it returns None. If the returned Path is relative, if will be
                appended to `cache_dir`; if it is absolute, it will be used directly (be
                very careful with this, as it has the ability to access files outside of
                the cache directory). If more than one translator is specified, they are
                called in order until one returns a Path, or it falls through to the
                default. Note that `url_to_path` operates on the original URL, not the
                URL generated by a `url_to_url` translator.

                If None, use the default translators for this :class:`FileCache` instance.
