        Parameters:
            paths: The path(s). These may be absolute or relative paths. They are joined
                together to form a final path. File operations can only be performed on
                absolute paths.
            file_cache: The :class:`FileCache` in which to store files retrieved from this
                path. If not specified, the default global :class:`FileCache` will be
                used.
            anonymous: If True, access cloud resources without specifying credentials. If
                False, credentials must be initialized in the program's environment. If
                None, use the default setting for the associated :class:`FileCache`
                instance.
            lock_timeout: How long to wait, in seconds, if another process is marked as
                retrieving the file before raising an exception. 0 means to not wait at
                all. A negative value means to never time out. None means to use the
                default value for the associated :class:`FileCache` instance.
            nthreads: The maximum number of threads to use when doing multiple-file
                retrieval or upload. If None, use the default value for the associated
                :class:`FileCache` instance.
            url_to_url: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate URLs
                into URLs. A user-specified translator function takes three arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str) -> str

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, and `path` is the rest of the URL. If the translator wants to
                override the default translation, it can return a new complete URL as a
                string. Otherwise, it returns None. If more than one translator is
                specified, they are called in order until one returns a URL, or it falls
                through to the default.

                If None, use the default translators for the associated :class:`FileCache`
                instance.
            url_to_path: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate
                URLs into local paths. By default, :class:`FileCache` uses a directory
                hierarchy consisting of ``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>/<source>/<path>``,
                where ``source`` is the URL prefix converted to a filesystem-friendly
                format (e.g. ``gs://bucket`` is converted to ``gs_bucket``). A
                user-specified translator function takes five arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str, cache_dir: Path,
                         cache_subdir: str) -> str | Path

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, `path` is the rest of the URL, `cache_dir` is the top-level
                directory of the cache (``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>``), and `cache_subdir`
                is the subdirectory specific to this scheme and remote. If the translator
                wants to override the default translation, it can return a Path.
                Otherwise, it returns None. If the returned Path is relative, if will be
                appended to `cache_dir`; if it is absolute, it will be used directly (be
                very careful with this, as it has the ability to access files outside of
                the cache directory). If more than one translator is specified, they are
                called in order until one returns a Path, or it falls through to the
                default. Note that `url_to_path` operates on the original URL, not the
                URL generated by a `url_to_url` translator.

                If None, use the default translators for the associated :class:`FileCache`
                instance.

                from. If specified, any values for these parameters in this constructor

            create_parents: If True, create all parent directories. This is useful when
                getting the local path of a file that will be uploaded.
            url_to_url: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate URLs

                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, and `path` is the rest of the URL. If the translator wants to
                override the default translation, it can return a new complete URL as a
                string. Otherwise, it returns None. If more than one translator is

                instance.
            url_to_path: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate
                URLs into local paths. By default, :class:`FileCache` uses a directory
                hierarchy consisting of ``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>/<source>/<path>``,
                where ``source`` is the URL prefix converted to a filesystem-friendly
                format (e.g. ``gs://bucket`` is converted to ``gs_bucket``). A
                user-specified translator function takes five arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str, cache_dir: Path,
                         cache_subdir: str) -> str | Path

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, `path` is the rest of the URL, `cache_dir` is the top-level
                directory of the cache (``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>``), and `cache_subdir`
                is the subdirectory specific to this scheme and remote. If the translator
                wants to override the default translation, it can return a Path.
                Otherwise, it returns None. If the returned Path is relative, if will be
                appended to `cache_dir`; if it is absolute, it will be used directly (be
                very careful with this, as it has the ability to access files outside of
                the cache directory). If more than one translator is specified, they are
                called in order until one returns a Path, or it falls through to the
                default. Note that `url_to_path` operates on the original URL, not the
                URL generated by a `url_to_url` translator.

                If None, use the default value given when this :class:`FCPath` was

        Returns:
            The Path (or list of Paths) of the URL (possibly as mapped by the
            `url_to_url` translators) in the cache directory, or as specified by the
            `url_to_path` translators. The files do not have to exist because a Path could
            be used for writing a file to upload. To facilitate this, a side effect of
            this call (if `create_parents` is True) is that the complete parent directory
            structure will be created for each returned Path.

            nthreads: The maximum number of threads to use. If None, use the default value
                given when this :class:`FCPath` was created.
            exception_on_fail: If True, if any file does not exist a FileNotFound
                exception is raised. If False, the function returns normally and any
                failed check is marked with the Exception that caused the failure in place
                of the returned modification time.
            url_to_url: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate URLs
                into URLs. A user-specified translator function takes three arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str) -> str

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, and `path` is the rest of the URL. If the translator wants to
                override the default translation, it can return a new complete URL as a
                string. Otherwise, it returns None. If more than one translator is
                specified, they are called in order until one returns a URL, or it falls
                through to the default.

                If None, use the default translators for the associated :class:`FileCache`
                instance.

        Returns:
            The modification time as a Unix timestamp if the file exists and the time can
            be retrieved, None otherwise. If `sub_path` was a list or tuple, then instead
            return a list of modification times in order. This always returns the
            modification time of the file on the remote source, even if there is a local
            copy. If you want the modification time of the local copy, you can call the
            normal ``stat`` function. If `exception_on_fail` is False, any modification
            time may be an Exception if that file does not exist or the modification time
            cannot be retrieved.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If a file does not exist.

            url_to_path: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate
                URLs into local paths. By default, :class:`FileCache` uses a directory
                hierarchy consisting of ``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>/<source>/<path>``,
                where ``source`` is the URL prefix converted to a filesystem-friendly
                format (e.g. ``gs://bucket`` is converted to ``gs_bucket``). A
                user-specified translator function takes five arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str, cache_dir: Path,
                         cache_subdir: str) -> str | Path

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, `path` is the rest of the URL, `cache_dir` is the top-level

                is the subdirectory specific to this scheme and remote. If the translator
                wants to override the default translation, it can return a Path.
                Otherwise, it returns None. If the returned Path is relative, if will be
                appended to `cache_dir`; if it is absolute, it will be used directly (be
                very careful with this, as it has the ability to access files outside of
                the cache directory). If more than one translator is specified, they are
                called in order until one returns a Path, or it falls through to the
                default. Note that `url_to_path` operates on the original URL, not the
                URL generated by a `url_to_url` translator.

                If None, use the default value given when this :class:`FCPath` was
                created.
        Returns:
            The Path of the filename in the temporary directory (or the original absolute
            path if local). If `sub_path` was a list or tuple of paths, then instead
            return a list of Paths of the filenames in the temporary directory (or the
            original absolute path if local). If `exception_on_fail` is False, any Path
            may be an Exception if that file does not exist or the download failed or a
            timeout occurred.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If a file does not exist or could not be downloaded, and
                exception_on_fail is True.

                exception_on_fail is True.

        Notes:
            File download is normally an atomic operation; a program will never see a
            partially-downloaded file, and if a download is interrupted there will be no
            file present. However, when downloading multiple files at the same time, as
            many files as possible are downloaded before an exception is raised.

        mode (like ``'w'`` or ``'wb'``) then the file will be first opened for write, and

            url_to_url: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate URLs

                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, and `path` is the rest of the URL. If the translator wants to
                override the default translation, it can return a new complete URL as a
                string. Otherwise, it returns None. If more than one translator is
                specified, they are called in order until one returns a URL, or it falls

            url_to_path: The function (or list of functions) that is used to translate
                URLs into local paths. By default, :class:`FileCache` uses a directory
                hierarchy consisting of ``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>/<source>/<path>``,
                where ``source`` is the URL prefix converted to a filesystem-friendly
                format (e.g. ``gs://bucket`` is converted to ``gs_bucket``). A
                user-specified translator function takes five arguments::

                    func(scheme: str, remote: str, path: str, cache_dir: Path,
                         cache_subdir: str) -> str | Path

                where `scheme` is the URL scheme (like ``"gs"`` or ``"file"``), `remote`
                is the name of the bucket or webserver or the empty string for a local
                file, `path` is the rest of the URL, `cache_dir` is the top-level
                directory of the cache (``<cache_dir>/<cache_name>``), and `cache_subdir`
                is the subdirectory specific to this scheme and remote. If the translator
                wants to override the default translation, it can return a Path.
                Otherwise, it returns None. If the returned Path is relative, if will be
                appended to `cache_dir`; if it is absolute, it will be used directly (be
                very careful with this, as it has the ability to access files outside of
                the cache directory). If more than one translator is specified, they are
                called in order until one returns a Path, or it falls through to the
                default. Note that `url_to_path` operates on the original URL, not the
                URL generated by a `url_to_url` translator.

                If None, use the default value given when this :class:`FCPath` was
                created.
            **kwargs: Any additional arguments are passed to the Python ``open()``
                function.
