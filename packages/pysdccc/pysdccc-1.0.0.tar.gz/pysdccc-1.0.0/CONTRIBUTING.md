# How to contribute to DrÃ¤gerwerk pysdccc

Welcome to our project. We are glad you want to improve this open source library. We at DrÃ¤ger want to create technology
for life and help to create a better future ðŸš€.

If you provide Markdown documents, issues, pull request or discussions we strongly encourage you
to [format your text](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
as it greatly helps to read and to understand your provided information.

For this open source project
the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/Draegerwerk/sdc11073/blob/master/Contributor_License_Agreement.md)
governs
all relevant activities and your contributions. By contributing to the project you agree to be bound by this Agreement
and to license your work accordingly.

## How to set up the project for development

- As we restricted pushing directly to one of pysdccc's branches, you have
  to [create a fork](https://github.com/Draegerwerk/pysdccc/fork) where you can push your changes before creating a
  pull request.
- Install the dependencies, e.g. with `uv sync --dev --all-extras`.
- Install [tox-uv](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-uv) if you use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) or [tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox/) if you don't
- Before making any commits, ensure
  you [sign your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

## Get support

By following these guidelines, you help us to address your concerns more efficiently.

### Create an issue

If you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improvements, we encourage you to create
an [issue](https://github.com/Draegerwerk/pysdccc/issues/new/).

Here's how you can do it effectively:

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, please search the existing issues to avoid duplicates. If
   you find an issue that addresses your problem or suggestion, feel free to add a comment to it.

2. **Provide Detailed Information**: Give a concise and informative title and fill out the rest of the form to your best
   knowledge. The more information you provide the better we can help you.

3. **Submit the Issue**: Once you've filled out all the necessary information, submit the issue.

## Coding Standards / Style Guide

This section outlines the coding standards and style guidelines for our project. Adhering to these guidelines ensures
code readability, maintainability, and consistency across the project. It's crucial for all contributors to follow these
practices to facilitate collaboration and code quality.

### General Principles

- **Readability**: Code should be written to be readable by humans. Clarity is preferred over cleverness.
- **Consistency**: Follow the established patterns and practices in the project.
- **Simplicity**: Strive for simplicity in your code. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

### Formatting / Static Code Analysis

- Use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to ensure your code adheres to our coding standards.
- Use [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) for type checking. Ensure your code is typed and passes pyright checks.

Checkout our [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/Draegerwerk/pysdccc/blob/main/pyproject.toml) for more details.

### Naming Conventions

- **Modules**: Use short, lowercase names. If necessary, use underscores to improve readability (e.g., `my_module`).
- **Classes**: Use the CapWords convention (e.g., `MyClass`).
- **Functions and Variables**: Use lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `my_function`).
- **Constants**: Use all uppercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).

### Comments

- Use inline comments sparingly and ensure they are relevant and add value.
- Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods. Follow
  the [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) format.

## Testing / Coverage

We take testing seriously to ensure the reliability and stability of our project. Here's how you can contribute to
testing:

### Running Tests

- To run the existing test suite, execute `pytest` at the root of the project. This will run all tests and display a
  report.
- Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

### Writing Tests

- When adding new features or fixing bugs, write tests that cover your changes. We strive for comprehensive test
  coverage to maintain code quality.
- Follow our project's conventions for test structure and naming. Tests should be placed in the `tests` directory.
- Use descriptive test function names that clearly state what is being tested.

By following these guidelines, you help ensure that our project remains stable, reliable, and easy to maintain. Thank
you for contributing to our tests!

## How to create a pull request

Creating a pull request is a critical step in contributing to our project. Here's how to do it effectively:

1. **Ensure Your Branch is Up-to-Date**: Before starting, make sure your branch is up-to-date with the branch you're
   planning to merge into.

2. **Check Your Changes**:
    - Run `tox` to check your changes. Ensure all tests pass and the code is formatted correctly.

3. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.

4. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your fork of the repository.

5. **Create the Pull Request**:
    - Navigate to the original repository you forked from.
    - Click on the "Pull requests" tab and then the "New pull request" button.
    - Choose your fork and the branch with your changes as the "compare" branch and the branch of our repository you
      want to merge into as the "base" branch.
    - Fill in the pull request form with a clear title and a detailed description of your changes.
    - If your pull request is related to an issue or discussion thread, reference it in the description or/and under
      the "Development" section.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
    - After submitting, at least one of our maintainers has to review your pull request. Be open to feedback also from
      other contributors and ready to make adjustments as needed.
    - If requested, make further commits to your branch to address feedback.

7. **Acceptance and Merge**:
    - Once your pull request is approved by a project maintainer and all CI checks pass, it will be merged.
    - Congratulations! You've successfully contributed to the project.
