def residue(G: GraphLike) -> int:
    r"""
    Returns the residue of a graph.

    The residue of a graph is defined as the number of zeros obtained at the
    end of the Havel-Hakimi process. This process determines whether a given
    degree sequence corresponds to a graphical sequence, which is a sequence
    of integers that can be realized as the degree sequence of a simple graph.

    **Havel-Hakimi Algorithm**:
    - Sort the degree sequence in non-increasing order.
    - Remove the largest degree (say, `d`) from the sequence.
    - Reduce the next `d` degrees by 1.
    - Repeat until all degrees are zero (graphical) or a negative degree is encountered (non-graphical).

    The residue is the count of zeros in the sequence when the algorithm terminates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.Graph
        The graph whose residue is to be calculated.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The residue of the graph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import graphcalc as gc
    >>> from graphcalc.generators import path_graph, complete_graph, cycle_graph

    >>> G = path_graph(4)  # Path graph with 4 vertices

    Returns the harmonic index of a graph.

    The harmonic index of a graph is defined as:

    where:
    - :math:`E(G)` is the edge set of the graph :math:`G`.
    - :math:`d(u)` is the degree of vertex :math:`u`.

    The harmonic index is commonly used in mathematical chemistry and network science
    to measure structural properties of molecular and network graphs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.Graph
        The graph.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The harmonic index of the graph.

    Examples

    Notes
    -----
    - The harmonic index assumes all edge weights are equal to 1. If you want
      to consider weighted graphs, modify the function to account for edge weights.
    - The harmonic index is symmetric with respect to the graph's structure, making
      it invariant under graph isomorphism.
