    """
    Assigns a tactical zone to a given (x, y) coordinate on the football pitch.

    The pitch is divided into a grid, and this function determines which zone the coordinate falls into.

    [[2, 4, 6],   # Top third of pitch

     [2, 4, 6]]   # Bottom third of pitch

    Args:
        x (float): The x-coordinate of the event, typically ranging from 0 to 100 (goal to goal).
        y (float): The y-coordinate of the event, typically ranging from 0 to 100 (touchline to touchline).
        x_min_max (tuple, optional): The minimum and maximum values for the x-coordinate. Defaults to (0, 100).
        y_min_max (tuple, optional): The minimum and maximum values for the y-coordinate. Defaults to (0, 100).
        zone_map (list of lists, optional): A 2D matrix representing zones. Each row represents a horizontal
                                          strip of the pitch from top to bottom. Each column represents

    Calculates the progression of a pass towards the opponent's goal and the final proximity to the goal.

    This function converts coordinate-based pass locations to meters, then calculates the change in distance
    to the goal line. It also determines whether the pass started and ended in the defensive or attacking half.
