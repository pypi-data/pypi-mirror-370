## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Alteryx Analytics Cloud Platform account
- OAuth2 credentials (Client ID, initial Access Token & Refresh Token)

### Install Options

**From GitHub (Recommended)**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupiterbak/OpenOne.git
cd OpenOne
pip install .
```

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables

Set up your OpenOne Analytics Platform credentials using environment variables:

```bash
# Required
export OPENONE_API_BASE_URL="https://api.eu1.alteryxcloud.com"
export OPENONE_TOKEN_ENDPOINT="https://pingauth-eu1.alteryxcloud.com/as"
export OPENONE_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id_here"
export OPENONE_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id_here"
export OPENONE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token_here"
export OPENONE_REFRESH_TOKEN="your_refresh_token"
# Optional
export OPENONE_PERSISTENT_FOLDER="~/.openone"
export OPENONE_VERIFY_SSL=1
```

#### Configuration File

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
OPENONE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.eu1.alteryxcloud.com
OPENONE_TOKEN_ENDPOINT=https://pingauth-eu1.alteryxcloud.com/as
OPENONE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
OPENONE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
OPENONE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
OPENONE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
OPENONE_PERSISTENT_FOLDER=~/.openone
OPENONE_VERIFY_SSL=1
```

#### MCP Server Setup - Claude Desktop Configuration

Add the following to your Claude configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openone": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "openone"],
      "env": {
        "OPENONE_API_BASE_URL": "https://api.eu1.alteryxcloud.com",
        "OPENONE_TOKEN_ENDPOINT": "https://pingauth-eu1.alteryxcloud.com/as",
        "OPENONE_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id_here",
        "OPENONE_PROJECT_ID": "your_project_id_here",
        "OPENONE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_access_token_here",
        "OPENONE_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your_refresh_token",
        "OPENONE_PERSISTENT_FOLDER": "~/.openone"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternative: Using a Configuration File

Instead of setting environment variables in the Claude config, you can create a `.env` file and reference it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openone": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "openone"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/project",
      "env": {
        "OPENONE_CONFIG_FILE": "/path/to/your/.env"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Testing the MCP Server

After configuration, restart Claude Desktop and test with these example queries:

**Basic Operations:**
- "List all schedules in my OpenOne Analytics Platform instance"
- "Show me my current workspace details and user count"
- "Get a count of all my plans and datasets"

**Schedule Management:**
- "Disable the schedule with ID 12345 and tell me why"
- "Show me all enabled schedules and their next run times"
- "Delete all schedules that haven't run in the last 30 days"

**Data Operations:**
- "List all my datasets and show their connection status"
- "Check if my database connections are working properly"
- "Show me all wrangled datasets and their input sources"

**Advanced Queries:**
- "Run plan abc123 and monitor its execution status"
- "Show me all workspace admins and their permissions"
- "List my publications and delete any older than 6 months"

### API Client Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
import client
from client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Configure the client
configuration = client.Configuration()
api_instance = client.ScheduleApi(client.ApiClient(configuration))

try:
    # List all schedules
    schedules = api_instance.list_schedules()
    print(f"Found {len(schedules)} schedules")
    
    # Get a specific schedule
    schedule = api_instance.get_schedule(schedule_id="12345")
    pprint(schedule)
    
except ApiException as e:
    print(f"API Error: {e}")
```
