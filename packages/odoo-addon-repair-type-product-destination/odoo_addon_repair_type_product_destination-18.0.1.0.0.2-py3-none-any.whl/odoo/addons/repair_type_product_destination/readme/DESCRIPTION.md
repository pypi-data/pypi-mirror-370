This is a technical module, and it does not provide any new functionality on its own. Due to the way transfers of repaired products work in Odoo, the following fields will not have any effect without additional code modifications.

This module introduces a **Product Destination Location field** in the repair order. The default value for this field is computed from the **Default Product Destination Location field of the associated Operation Type**.

This module essentially serves as a template, providing the groundwork for further customization. To make use of the functionality it introduces, extend this module to implement additional features in the repair transfer workflow.
