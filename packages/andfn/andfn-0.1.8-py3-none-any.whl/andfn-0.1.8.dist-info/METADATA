# AnDFN, Analytical Discrete Fracture Network

## Introduction
AnDFN is a computer program for the modelling of groundwater flow in a discrete fracture network (DFN). The program is based on the Analytic Element Method (AEM) and is distributed as a Python package with various modules and scripts.

The documentation for AnDFN is available [here](https://eriktoller.github.io/andfn/).

## Installation
AnDFN can be installed from PyPi.

Installation:
```
pip install andfn
```

Update:
```
pip install andfn --upgrade
```

Uninstall
```
pip uninstall andfn
```

### Dependencies
`andfn` has the following required dependencies:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scipy`
- `pyvista`
- `numba`
- `h5py`

and the following optional dependencies:
- `pyyaml` (for using the YAML configuration file)
- `matplotlib` (for some optional plots)

## Functionality
AnDFN currently have the following functionality:
- Generate random DFN
- Compute the intersections of a DFN
- Solve the AEM model for a DFN
- Plot the flow net for the AEM model
- Import DFNs
- Load and save DFNs

## Getting started
A template for a simple AnDFN model and several examples are available in the `examples` folder (under development).

## Citation
The basic theory for this program is published in:
