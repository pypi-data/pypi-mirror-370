### 🚀 Features
- Added `.github/FUNDING.yml` for GitHub Sponsors support.

### 🛠️ CI/CD
- CI now tests Debian and Snap builds after publishing to Test PyPI, catching packaging issues before release.

- Fixed step labels to correctly distinguish between test and production builds.

### 🏗️ Build System
- Refactored version management to use setuptools_scm `write_to` feature for consistent versioning across all packaging formats.
- Updated debian packaging to build from sdist with embedded version information.
- Simplified snapcraft versioning to use `craftctl` and package version dynamically.
- Added dummy `_version.py` for development fallback when setuptools_scm hasn't run.
- Moved `snapcraft.yaml` to project root for better source access and conventional structure.
- Upgraded snap base from core22 to core24 for better Python 3.12+ support and modern Ubuntu 24.04 LTS foundation.
- Updated snapcraft to use `adopt-info` with setuptools_scm for consistent version formatting across all package types.
