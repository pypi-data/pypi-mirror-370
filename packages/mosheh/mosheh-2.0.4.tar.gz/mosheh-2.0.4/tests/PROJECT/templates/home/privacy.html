                This Privacy Policy describes how your data is (or more accurately, <strong>is not</strong>) collected,
                used, and
                protected when you use the <strong>sWarden</strong> platform — a browser-based, encrypted, and anonymous
                secret
                manager for storing passphrases, notes, and card information.

            <p>
                We designed sWarden to avoid collecting or storing any personal identifiers. Specifically, we <strong>do
                    not</strong> collect:

            <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                The platform is intentionally designed to minimize data collection. The only information processed is
                strictly necessary to provide core functionality:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>12-words recovery list and user passphrase are never sent to the server. They remain solely on your
                    device and are essential for encryption/decryption</li>
                <li>Stored secrets (passphrases, notes, cards) are encrypted <strong>client-side</strong> (in your
                    browser) or at rest
                    using a private key derived from your passphrase</li>
                <li>Encrypted vault data may be stored server-side, but never in plain text.</li>
                <li></strong>No admin, developer, or third party</strong> can view, decrypt, or access your secrets.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In short: <strong>you are the only person who can decrypt your data</strong>.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Encryption at rest: Encrypted vaults are stored using a private key derived from your passphrase and

                Under GDPR, data processing is based on:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Performance of a contract: Data storage is required to fulfill the core service</li>
