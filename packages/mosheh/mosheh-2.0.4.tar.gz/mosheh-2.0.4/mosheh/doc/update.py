"""
Used to update the Nav and optionally the homepage of a documentation site,
this file handles the `types.basic.CodebaseDict` and rewrites the `mkdocs.yml`
Nav structure based on its contents.

The only existing function here is `update_doc`, which encapsulates all
underlying logic and utility calls.

There’s logic for safely cleaning the codebase, rebuilding the navigation tree,
modifying the YAML structure, and copying over the README to serve as homepage,
all using internal calls for functions such as `process_codebase` and
`get_update_set_nav`.

    Updates an existing documentation for a Python codebase using MkDocs.

    This function updates a MkDocs project at the specified output path, rewrites a
    configuration file and processes the provided codebase to generate documentation.

    Key concepts:
        - Kwargs: By starting args with "*", this function only accepts key-word
        arguments.
        - MkDocs: A static site generator that's geared towards project documentation.
        - Codebase Processing: The function relies on `process_codebase` to handle the
        codebase structure and populate the documentation content based on Python files
        and their stmts.
        - Configuration: Rebuilds a `mkdocs.yml` Nav config file with new project
        details.
        - Homepage: If `readme_path` is provided, so the `index.md` file provided by
        MkDocs is overwriten by the `README.md` found at provided `readme_path` file.
